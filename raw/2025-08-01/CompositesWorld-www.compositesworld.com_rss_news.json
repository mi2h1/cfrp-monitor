The focus has been on the entire process chain, from filament production and printing to the functionally integrated lightweight structure. <em>CW </em>published <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/demonstrating-functionalized-cost-effective-composites-using-additive-extrusion\" target=\"_blank\">an overview of the EmpowerAX open platform</a> in 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Building directly on these findings, DLR is actively pursuing the&nbsp;SchallFTP project, which aims to apply a sonic infusion cell for the impregnation and manufacture of fiber-reinforced&nbsp;thermoplastic semi-finished products &mdash;&nbsp;such as filaments &mdash; in an industrial context. A key area of the project is the advancement of circular economy principles within additive manufacturing. Central to this is the question of how fiber&nbsp;waste can be transformed into new, pseudo continuously reinforced 3D printing filaments&nbsp;in a resource-efficient, cost-effective way with strong application potential.</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear: carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) retain significant material value, even at the end of their service life. Landfilling such materials is not only environmentally questionable but also heavily restricted by EU legislation (1999/31/EC). Against this backdrop, DLR is developing a process within the SchallFTP&nbsp;project that will enable&nbsp;efficient recycling of production waste and reject components into high-quality filaments for fiber-reinforced 3D printing.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-dlr-schallftp-rcf-vcf-comparison.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"Comparison of strengths of vCF- and rCF-based filaments.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-dlr-schallftp-rcf-vcf-comparison.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Comparison of strengths of vCF- and rCF-based filaments.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>To achieve this,&nbsp;carbon fibers&nbsp;coming from production rejects and waste (rCF) are combined with high-performance thermoplastics (such as PPS) through a specially adapted impregnation process. This in-house method enables a fiber&nbsp;volume content of up to 50%, while maintaining minimal degradation, thus&nbsp;making the recycled fibers viable for industrial use. The resulting filaments offer comparable design freedom to those made with virgin carbon fibers (vCF), while significantly reducing both costs and resource consumption, the DLR reports. This makes them particularly attractive for non-load-bearing applications in aerospace, automotive&nbsp;and other mobility sectors,&nbsp;ranging from cabin components to structural parts in vehicle construction.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><img alt=\"Illustration on the subject of rCF.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-dlr-schallftp-process.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></div>\n\n<p>Illustration on the subject of rCF.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The DLR&rsquo;s goal is to preserve the material value of rCF as much as possible, closing the loop&nbsp;in lightweight construction in a truly sustainable way. Future research will focus on the reliable processing of different recyclates, particularly regarding fiber&nbsp;quality, contamination&nbsp;and ageing. The objective is to establish robust, industry-ready processes that enable reproducible transformation of recycled fibers into new semi-finished products&nbsp;from filament to functional structure.</p>\n\n<p>Thermoplastic matrix systems also play a key role here. Targeted use of these materials is expected to simplify and accelerate recycling processes. Supported by simulation methods and new quality standards, these efforts aim to boost industry confidence in the use of recycled fibers. In the long term, the DLR seeks to work closely with material producers and application industries to create a standardized, certifiable value chain for rCF-based products.</p>\n\n<p>Insights into the latest developments in high-performance fiber&nbsp;recycling will be presented at the annual <a href=\"https://dlr.expert/eax-science-day-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">EmpowerAX Science Day</a> on Oct. 8,&nbsp;2025 in Stade, Germany. The topic will be showcased as one of many exciting research focal points. Participating researchers look forward to engaging directly with attendees and jointly discussing the next steps toward&nbsp;a sustainable, circular fiber-processing future.</p>"

KG</a>&nbsp;(Bonn, Germany), a Textron company, has received an&nbsp;order from a leading automotive OEM for a full battery-electric vehicle (BEV) thermoplastic composite (TPC) lower battery housing unit. The lower housing is part of the company&rsquo;s Pentatonic battery enclosure portfolio, facilitating BEV and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) production (read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/moving-toward-sustainable-automotive-parts-manufacturing-\" target=\"_blank\">Moving toward sustainable automotive parts manufacturing</a>&rdquo;).</p>\n\n<p>The Kautex Pentatonic product line offers lightweight, customizable electric vehicle (EV) solutions made from TPC&nbsp;or metal-composite&nbsp;hybrids. These solutions include products that enhance the thermal management of the battery pack and contribute to the overall lightweight design, boosting vehicle performance and extending driving range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The lower housing seals and protects the vehicle battery while meeting extensive structural and stringent thermal requirements, such as crush and bottom impact testing, and external and internal fire tests. Kautex says it will be produced for a major BEV platform, spanning across multiple vehicle brands.</p>\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;Joerg Rautenstrauch, president and&nbsp;CEO of Kautex, Pentatonic offers&nbsp;advantages over its conventional metal counterparts, with lower cost through a reduction in components due to its high functional integration and thus a leaner bill of material. Use of TPC helps to lower the carbon footprint of the part, while the lightweight housing contributes to reduced&nbsp;carbon emissions while driving. This multi-material approach provides corrosion resistance with no compromise in performance throughout the lifespan of the vehicle. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This order marks Kautex&rsquo;s second Pentatonic business win, following its initial success in January 2023 with a full BEV underbody protection skid plate that entered serial production in 2024. Pentatonic has garnered numerous awards, including <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/kautex-wins-spe-grand-innovation-award-for-thermoplastic-composite-battery-enclosure-with-integrated-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">the SPE Grand Innovation Award</a> in Europe, as well as the Lingxuan and Gasgoo Innovation Awards in China. Additionally, Kautex has deployed three on-road test vehicles in the U.S., Japan and Europe, validating the performance of full BEV and hybrid Pentatonic enclosures across various terrains and weather conditions. Collectively, these vehicles have been road-tested for more than&nbsp;100,000 miles.&nbsp;</p>"

Source |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/en/service/imprint\" target=\"_blank\">&copy; DLR</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The now completed GVT is an important milestone for investigating the vibration behavior of an aircraft. The goal is to identify critical vibrations that can occur during flight, takeoff and landing. This determines whether an aircraft is safe and thus airworthy. For HAP-alpha, the successful GVT marks a key step on the way to first flight tests next year, which will involve basic flight maneuvers at low altitude.</p>\n\n<p>During the GVT, numerous sensors were used to record the dynamic properties of the platform, which was fitted with electromechanical vibrators so that its vibration characteristics could be identified. A particular challenge of the GVT on HAP-alpha was its very lightweight and therefore very flexible design.</p>\n\n<p>The acquired data will now be used to update simulation models and predict flight behavior even more precisely,&nbsp;especially during maneuvers, turbulence and gusts of wind. &ldquo;This allows the project team to focus on the upcoming complete system tests, which will mark the completion of ground testing and enable subsequent flight testing,&rdquo;&nbsp;says HAP project leader Florian Nikodem from the DLR Institute of Flight Systems.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>HAP-alpha project</h3>\n\n<p>Under the leadership of the Institute of Flight Systems, the DLR aims to build comprehensive expertise for the development of high-performance, high-altitude solar-powered aircraft. HAP-alpha will also serve as a carrier platform for testing sensor systems and system technologies under realistic operating conditions in the lower stratosphere at an altitude of approximately 20 kilometers. In addition to the platform itself, DLR is developing two sensor systems for use on HAP-alpha, as well as optimized evaluation methods.</p>\n\n<p>The HAP-alpha project was launched in 2018, with the DLR pooling a wide range of expertise from the fields of aeronautics, space and security with a <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/en/latest/news/2025/uncrewed-high-flying-solar-aircraft-hap-alpha-passes-key-ground-tests\" target=\"_blank\">total of 16 participating institutes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First test flights with the technology demonstrator&nbsp;are planned for 2025, with the first flights initially planned at low altitude at the National Test Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Along the way, the project will pass through several review gates at which the status of the project and the feasibility of achieving the objectives will be assessed with the involvement of external experts.</p>\n\n<p>Once the aircraft has been sufficiently tested and the ground crew&rsquo;s procedures have been properly established, expansion stages of HAP-alpha will successively fly at altitudes of up to 20 kilometers. Extensive demonstration flights with the developed payload systems will then be carried out at high altitudes. In order to realize the high-altitude flights, the team is in talks with suitable flight test facilities around the world that have the necessary wide-ranging ground and air exclusion zones up to high altitudes.</p>\n</div>"

The company worked with aerospace company <a href=\"http://beta.team/\" target=\"_blank\">Beta Technologies</a> (South Burlington, Vt., U.S.) to&nbsp;achieve this landmark, conducting all testing of its propeller on Beta&rsquo;s&nbsp;electric propulsion systems (electric engines), which are designed and manufactured in-house by Beta.</p>\n\n<p>Hartzell says this milestone signifies the maturity, certifiability&nbsp;and commercialization of the AAM industry, and next-generation electric aviation. It is also a practical step forward in the industry&rsquo;s collective ability to support the growing demand for safe, low-cost, and efficient urban and regional air transport.</p>\n\n<p>With this certification, Hartzell&rsquo;s propeller is the first to earn FAA type certification specifically for integration with electric propulsion systems. These systems, like Beta&rsquo;s, are capable of managing a wide range of different loads and conditions &mdash; from regenerative braking to startup &mdash; all of which Hartzell&rsquo;s propellers are&nbsp;designed to support. The approval comes after thousands of hours of ground and flight testing over 4&nbsp;years, and verifies that the propeller exceeds the rigorous performance and safety standards of FAA Part 35.</p>\n\n<p>Hartzell&rsquo;s design is a five bladed, carbon fiber, ground-adjustable fixed-pitch propeller. Both companies have worked on the propeller development since 2021, from initial aerodynamic modeling and design to full-scale testing and validation. The result is a high-performance, low-noise propeller tailored specifically for electric engines. Beta&nbsp;will use Hartzell&rsquo;s propeller to optimize the performance and safety profile of both its Alia&nbsp;VTOL and Alia CTOL aircraft.&nbsp;The propeller is also built to serve all AAM aircraft that use&nbsp;similar electric propulsion systems.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With its decades of experience across all types of aircraft, Hartzell Propeller has understood from the beginning the unique challenges and opportunities of electric aviation,&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>says&nbsp;Kyle Clark, Founder and CEO of Beta&nbsp;Technologies. &ldquo;Their engineering precision and deep certification experience have assisted us as we bring this aircraft to market and walk through our own certification steps. We&nbsp;look forward to getting this certified propeller in the air as we continue the process of certifying our electric engines, as well as our Alia CTOL and VTOL.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Beta&nbsp;has been flying its Alia&nbsp;CTOL and VTOL aircraft with Hartzell&rsquo;s propellers for more than 4&nbsp;years &mdash;&nbsp;including completion of a&nbsp;crewed transition of an eVTOL, and several long-range flights with its fixed-wing, including a coast-to-coast trip across the U.S., and now a grand tour of Europe.</p>"

The DLR&nbsp;investigated the difference in mechanical and morphological characteristics of laminates produced on metallic and polymeric molds. First, carbon fiber-reinforced LMPAEK&nbsp;laminates for both mold types were produced and their&nbsp;tensile strength, interlaminar shear strength&nbsp;and morphological characteristics analyzed&nbsp;using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Despite differences in stiffness and thermal conductivity between the materials, the DLR found no statistically significant differences in the mechanical or crystalline properties of the laminates.</p>\n\n<p>Findings indicate that&nbsp;PA6&nbsp;in its cast form is a viable, low-cost option for nonheated AFP tooling. The DLR expects to extend this research into its 3D printing activities to open up new possibilities for efficient and flexible composites manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-477X/9/7/367\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete study here</a>.</p>"
