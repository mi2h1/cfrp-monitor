The HondaJet <em>Echelon</em>, planned to achieve first flight in 2026, will feature a larger cabin with increased passenger capacity and range over previous HondaJet models, bringing the award-winning design features of the HondaJet to a new segment of the aviation market.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/spirit-aerosystems-to-build-new-composite-fuselage-for-hondajet\" target=\"_blank\">June 2023</a>, Honda Aircraft announced Spirit AeroSystem&rsquo;s&nbsp;(Wichita, Kan., U.S.) expanded role in developing the aircraft&rsquo;s&nbsp;build-to-print composite fuselage and a composite bonded frame.&nbsp;Honda Aircraft&rsquo;s production department began introducing specialized assembly lines early in 2024, with tooling installation completed at the end of the year. With work on the first major sub-assembly of the <em>Echelon</em> underway, the program has entered its next development phase. The company is producing test articles to facilitate the maturation of the design in support of aircraft certification.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2025, the Honda Aircraft Company Advanced Systems Integration Test Facility (ASITF) held a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> development simulator, which now serves several functions, including a vehicle for system development testing. The development simulator uses data from wind tunnel models of the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> and real aircraft hardware to predict aircraft performance in operational conditions, enabling engineers to evaluate key aircraft systems prior to the test aircraft taking flight.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are excited to see the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> program gaining momentum,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Honda Aircraft Co. senior vice president and chief commercial officer Amod Kelkar. &ldquo;We are proud of the achievements we have made in the last several months, and it is just the beginning. We have a series of additional targets to hit in the coming months, each of which will bring us closer to the actual first flight next year [2026]. Market interest in the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> grows, with almost 500 letters of intent signed to date, and numbers increasing every month.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> is planned to become the &ldquo;first&rdquo; light jet with a range capable of nonstop transcontinental flight across the U.S., offering 40% better fuel efficiency than some midsize jets. The new aircraft will introduce product features previously unseen in the HondaJet line, while still building on the high performance and operational efficiency of the original HondaJet.</p>"

Source | Leki&nbsp;Lenhart GmbH</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ditf.de/en/index/ditf.html\" target=\"_blank\">German Institutes of Textile and Fiber Research Denkendorf</a>&nbsp;(DITF) and <a href=\"https://www.leki.com/int/en\" target=\"_blank\">Leki&nbsp;Lenhart GmbH</a> (Kirchheim unter Teck, Germany) have collaborated on a project to develop a hiking pole made largely from renewable raw materials &mdash; in this case natural fiber composites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consumers are increasingly asking for environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional materials. Aluminum and carbon fibers, for example, require a lot of energy to manufacture and are usually difficult to recycle. Therefore, the aim of the research project was to develop sustainable and durable sports poles made of hemp fibers and a bio-based matrix, which are manufactured using the pultrusion process.</p>\n\n<p>The shaft of the final hiking pole product is made of regionally harvested hemp fibers that have been processed to rovings using the&nbsp;Kemafil-process &mdash; a wrapping process that gives the fibers a stable, rope-like structure through an interweaving technique. The matrix used was developed together with project partner&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bio-composites.eu/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Bio-Composites and More GmbH</a>&nbsp;(Ipsheim, Germany) and is based on epoxidized linseed oil, which can be cured in the same way as a synthetic epoxide resin. The matrix is up to 42% organic and is ideal for the energy- and material-efficient pultrusion process. At DITF, approximately 16 meters of tubular profiles were successfully pultruded on a laboratory scale. The manufactured parts have a smooth surface and the natural fibers used are visible.</p>\n\n<p>The suitability of the process for series production was demonstrated by manufacturing under industrial conditions at&nbsp;industrial partner&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cg-tec.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">CG TEC GmbH</a>&rsquo;s (Spalt, Germany) site.</p>\n\n<p>Other components besides the shaft are also sustainable: The wrist strap is made of a natural fiber fabric and the attachments are made of a bio-based polymer. This means that more than&nbsp;64%&nbsp;of the entire hiking pole is made from renewable raw materials.</p>\n\n<p>Initial market analyses indicate very good commercial viability and user satisfaction. While hemp fibers have previously been used mainly in applications with low mechanical requirements, the DITF reports that the product proves that this natural fiber material is also suitable for resilient structures. The hiking poles manufactured achieve a bending strength comparable to that of aluminum poles and even offer improved damping properties. Thanks to its reduced carbon footprint, the product is sustainable and environmentally friendly.</p>\n\n<p><em>The DITF thanks the Federal Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg for funding the&nbsp;Hanf-Profil&nbsp;research project.</em></p>"

Source | &ldquo;Low-temperature cure bismaleimide composite tools with excellent tool life&rdquo; presented&nbsp;by Kaneka Aerospace and Janicki</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At CAMX 2025, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/kaneka-aerospace\" target=\"_blank\">Kaneka Aerospace</a> (Benicia, California, U.S.) and <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/janicki-industries\" target=\"_blank\">Janicki Industries</a> (Sedro-Woolley, Washington, U.S.) presented results from a joint study on Kaneka TP2230, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/low-temp-demold-bmi-prepreg-enables-low-cost-master-molds\" target=\"_blank\">newly developed</a> low-temperature-cure bismaleimide (BMI) tooling prepreg.</p>\n\n<p>These results have shown that&nbsp;TP2230 offers a major advancement over conventional BMI tooling, which typically requires a 350&deg;F (177&deg;C) cure and expensive high-temperature masters. By enabling demold at&nbsp;250&deg;F (120&deg;C) and a freestanding post-cure, TP2230 enables&nbsp;the use of more affordable master materials &mdash; reducing tooling costs and production time.</p>\n\n<p>TP2230 delivers strong mechanical properties and long-term thermal stability. Tests with aerospace-grade carbon fiber fabrics indicates&nbsp;high strength, stiffness and toughness. Microscopy has confirmed structural features that enhance damage resistance.</p>\n\n<p>In thermal aging studies, TP2230 maintained integrity with minimal weight loss and delayed microcracking, lasting several times longer than traditional BMI systems. It exhibited less than 1.2% weight loss after 10,000 hours at 350&deg;F (177&deg;C), with hints of microcrack initiation delayed until 6,000-7,500 hours. Even after 10,000 hours, cracking was limited and not close to the level of crack transfer to part or vacuum loss.</p>\n\n<p>Janicki Industries confirmed TP2230&rsquo;s ease of use and durability in tooling trials. The material showed optimal handling, smooth surface finish&nbsp;and consistent performance across multiple cycles. Tools retained vacuum integrity well beyond typical expectations, with only minor wear observed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;By combining reduced cure temperature with long-term thermal stability, TP2230 opens new opportunities for economical, high-performance tooling,&rdquo; says Kaneka Aerospace.</p>\n\n<p>Janicki is now scaling up to larger, more complex tool geometries. &ldquo;The low-temperature initial cure of TP2230 enables&nbsp;us to streamline our tool manufacturing process, opening a pathway to reducing tooling costs and shortening production times while maintaining the high-temperature, high-durability performance of BMI tools,&rdquo; notes Todd &ldquo;TJ&rdquo; Chace, senior director of R&amp;D at Janicki. &ldquo;Backed by robust test data, it stands up to the most demanding conditions of our customers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>Learn more at Kaneka Aerospace&rsquo;s upcoming webinar, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/events/details/tool-smarter-repair-stronger-kanekas-low-temp-bmi-and-advanced-resin-repair-system\">Tool Smarter, Repair Stronger: Kaneka&rsquo;s Low-temp BMI and Advanced Resin Repair System</a>&rdquo; on Nov. 5, 2025.</em></p>"

The ECCA will provide a platform for knowledge sharing and cooperation, driving collective action to establish truly circular, sustainable value chains for composite materials. Alignment with European Union (EU) policy frameworks such as the Green Industrial Deal and the Circular Economy Act&nbsp;will be key to the Alliance&rsquo;s success. Through EuCIA, the ECCA has already opened a dialogue with EU policy officers.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the ECCA we aim to enable effective stakeholder engagement and build consensus within the value chain on the priority actions for the future,&rdquo; says professor Roberto Frassine, president of the EuCIA.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will set measurable, transparent targets to track progress. Alliances such as the ECCA can help shape future legislation and one of our first actions will be to provide the composites industry&rsquo;s perspective on the new Circular Economy Act.&rdquo; The Circular Economy Act, due for adoption in 2026, aims to accelerate the transition to a more circular economy and increase use of recycled materials.</p>\n\n<p>The ECCA has established five Working Groups and their first meetings took place in August. These groups are now developing their roadmaps toward circularity.</p>\n\n<p>On Dec. 4, 2025, ECCA and EuCIA members, representatives from the European Commission and the press will meet in Brussels for the Alliance&rsquo;s first General Assembly. This event will provide an opportunity to discuss the ECCA&rsquo;s goals with EU policy makers and confirm the next steps on the European composites industry&rsquo;s journey to a sustainable, circular&nbsp;and competitive future.</p>\n\n<p>JEC World 2026, taking place March 10, 12, 2026, will provide an additional opportunity&nbsp;for ECCA members to meet and review the progress achieved one year after the Alliance&rsquo;s launch.</p>\n\n<p><em>New members are welcome. The objectives of the ECCA, the Declaration of the Alliance and application to join are available on the EuCIA website: <a href=\"https://eucia.eu/ecca/\" target=\"_blank\">ECCA - EuCIA</a>.</em></p>"
