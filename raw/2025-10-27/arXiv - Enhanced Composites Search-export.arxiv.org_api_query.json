Recently, machine learning (ML) based approaches have emerged as\npromising alternatives to traditional multiscale methods. However, existing ML\nsurrogate constitutive models struggle in capturing long-range dependencies and\ngeneralization across microstructures. The recent advancements in\nattention-based Transformer architectures open the door to a more powerful\nclass of surrogate models. Attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in natural language processing and computer vision. In this work,\nwe introduce a surrogate (meta) model, namely ViT-Transformer, using a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder which are both driven\nby the self-attention mechanism. The ViT encoder extracts microstructural\nfeatures from material images, while the decoder is a masked Transformer\nencoder that combines the latent geometrical features with the macroscopic\nstrain input sequence to predict the corresponding stress response. To enhance\ntraining, we propose a random extract training algorithm that improves\nrobustness to sequences of variable length. We design and construct a compact\nyet diverse dataset via data augmentation, and validate the surrogate model\nusing various composite material images and loading scenarios. Several\nnumerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and accuracy of the\nViT-Transformer model and the training algorithm.",
