        "value": "<p>Sujin Lee, a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow, was curious to understand why a mantis shrimp’s appendage did not break when it smashed the shells of other creatures with the force of a .22 caliber bullet. Lee joined NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) materials research engineer Edwin Chan to discover how this is possible. The result of the research led to the development of an advanced material based on the Bouligand structures of the exoskeleton of these amazing creatures that is tough enough to withstand challenging aerospace applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers synthesized the structures from cellulose nanocrystals found in plant fibers and the nanocrystals assembled into plates and layered on top of each other forming synthetic Bouligand structures. Using high-frequency sound waves, the researchers modified the crystals then formed them into thin films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The films were tested using high-intensity lasers to fire microprojectiles made of silica. The microprojectiles can leave indentations but can also bounce back depending on how the energy spreads in shockwaves after impact. By making the nanocrystals thicker, the films redirected the shockwaves from the impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chan explained, “The results and insights of this research mark an important advance in bioinspired materials design with applications for aerospace, such as helping spacecraft survive the impact of micrometeoroids and protecting orbiting satellites that collide with debris.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team sees future uses of the bioinspired material in applications such as blast-resistant building materials, bullet-resistant glass, protective helmets, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These findings suggest that there are different ways to design materials to absorb impact, and we can use this knowledge to create more resilient and longer-lasting materials,” said Chan. “If you’re a boxer in the ring, you want to fight nine rounds, not just one.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/nist-researchers-develop-advanced-material-based-on-exoskeleton-of-mantis-shrimp/\">NIST Researchers Develop Advanced Material Based on Exoskeleton of Mantis Shrimp</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

The event marked a significant milestone, breaking ACMA’s previous attendance record and underscoring the growing momentum behind composites policy engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the event, attendees participated in more than 80 Congressional meetings with lawmakers and staff from both the House and Senate, effectively elevating the voice of the composites industry. In addition to these impactful Hill meetings, the Fly-In provided valuable networking opportunities for participants to build relationships with peers and ACMA staff who share a strong commitment to advancing the industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants met with dozens of Congressional and Senate offices on several important topics for the industry, including:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Promoting continued innovation and expansion of the industry through sound tax policy </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Supporting a science-based process for evaluating styrene  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Explaining the impact of tariffs and supply chain uncertainty on the ability to manufacture advanced materials in the United States </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s Fly-In featured a standout lineup of expert speakers and federal officials who shared their knowledge on critical issues including tax policy and the economy. Attendees gained valuable insight from high-level briefings, including a session with Nancy Beck, Ph.D., DABT, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who explained the agency’s current approach to chemical regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The event also included remarks from U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a long-time champion of composites and their role in advancing clean energy, infrastructure, and domestic manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another agenda highlight was the launch of ACMA’s “Smart Policy, Smarter Materials” campaign, an advocacy initiative aimed at preventing misguided regulation that could harm American manufacturing and innovation. The campaign emphasizes the essential role styrene-based composites play in transportation, infrastructure, and clean energy, while calling for regulatory decisions grounded in sound science and smart policy.

Viritech’s graphene nanomaterial is processed at Cygnet Texkimp’s Innovation Centre using the DEECOM composites recycling solution, applying pressure and superheated steam to separate the fibers from the polymer matrix. The reclaimed fibers are unwound and rewound onto bobbins to be readied for reuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally recycled carbon fiber is processed as short fibers and limited to use for sheet molding compound, extrusion, or fiber reinforced plastics. The recovery and unwinding of continuous fibers allows the recycled fibers to be used in place of virgin fibers in pultrusion, weaving, towpreg, filament winding, and other applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Yan Liu, senior research and development specialist at Cygnet Texkimp and project leader said, “Our partnership with Viritech demonstrates the potential for hydrogen tanks to be recycled at a meaningful rate. This is significant because it supports the automotive industry’s work to achieve true circularity in the manufacture of filament-wound parts by recovering fibers in a way that’s convenient for their reuse and maximizes their potential ongoing value.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aislinn Kiely, project delivery lead at APC, added, “The capabilities that Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech have developed while working on the FCVGen2.0 project highlight the mutual benefits that can be unlocked by undertaking collaborative research &amp; development activities. Cygnet Texkimp’s recovery and recycling process, coupled with Viritech’s material development, offer a significant opportunity to support the transition to zero-emission vehicles and establish a zero-emission vehicle manufacturing supply chain in the UK.” Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech are continuing the partnership to extend the development of filament winding technology for sustainable, efficient manufacturing for hydrogen pressure vessels.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/cygnet-texkimp-and-viritech-recovering-continuous-carbon-fibers-from-h2-tanks-for-ford-project/\">Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech Recovering Continuous Carbon Fibers from H2 Tanks for Ford Project</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Growth in technology and the use of advanced materials in sporting goods to enhance an athlete&#8217;s performance is becoming more common as the use of these materials becomes better accepted. What is not always evident is how the use of advanced materials impact the athlete’s physical health. Ankur Padhye, a doctoral student at Eastern Carolina University’s College of Allied Health Sciences’ Department of Physical Therapy, focused on the impact of carbon fiber insoles in running shoes on the foot health of runners and made some encouraging discoveries for athletes and potentially for others as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As manufacturers have added carbon fiber plates into the soles of running shoes, research shows that the soles give while running and this process creates a springing function giving runners up to a 4% increase in efficiency. VO2 max and exertion levels, essential components in fast and efficient running, are enhanced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for understanding the impact of running on the foot itself, past research focused primarily on how bare feet land on the ground and how that impact influences the forefoot. Padhye wanted to dig deeper and discover the impact on bones, tendons, and joints when runners wore shoes with the newly popular carbon fiber insoles. Working with Dr. John Willson, a professor in the PT department, the team concentrated on the mechanics of wearing the new technology regarding how the stability of the carbon fiber insole insulates the foot from repetitive stress injuries and how the muscles work differently to propel the foot forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional research on body movement requires reflective markers to be affixed to points of the body so cameras can sense and recreate the movement digitally. In order for Padhye’s team to prove their hypothesis that the carbon fiber insoles not only make runners faster but also reduce load on the foot, holes were cut in the carbon fiber material in the shoes and in control shoes so the markers could be affixed to the feet of participants. Motion-capture technology allowed the team to assess the impact of the carbon fiber insoles on the subjects’ foot anatomy, and they liked what they saw. It appears that the carbon fiber shoes reduce loads on forefoot bones and joints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There may be some real applications for people with foot and ankle injuries, and possibly even knee injuries,” Dr. Willson said. “Previous studies have just looked at the whole foot as a unit. What is causing the increase or decrease in propulsion forces? We’ll be able to separate those influences.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/ecu-researcher-proving-carbon-fiber-running-shoe-insoles-improve-performance-and-foot-health/\">ECU Researcher Proving Carbon Fiber Running Shoe Insoles Improve Performance and Foot Health</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

Concrete is brittle and as the roads and bridges age shrinkage cracks form leading to corrosion of the steel and to costly structural damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams from Arizona State University’s (ASU) School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment’s Structural Mechanics and Infrastructure Materials and Cement and Concrete Materials laboratories, the Arizona Department of Transportation (DOT), and Maricopa County DOT partnered to develop an ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) to connect bridge elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fiber-reinforced concrete was created from locally sourced materials and the fibers strengthen the concrete material allowing engineers to redistribute the same amount of rebar with smaller fibers. The result is a faster and less costly repair process, cutting project time from six months down to as few as 10 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An actual-size reinforced concrete section was evaluated in the ASU lab for sheer, compressive, and tensile strength as well as fatigue resistance. With successful test results achieved, the grout and key joints on a bridge in Maricopa County were filled with new UHPC instead of the traditional rebar-and-concrete resulting in a faster and less costly repair of the bridge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The grout key is supposed to help transfer load from one slab to the adjacent slab to help carry the load,” Barzin Mobasher, Ph.D., P.E., M.ASCE, a civil engineering professor at Arizona State University explained. “When the grout goes bad, the slab has to carry all the load by itself. By putting these UHPC keys back in there, we can get the structure back to where it acts as a unit instead of a bunch of individual slabs.” “I think it’s important when agencies and universities work together that they get some of the key players involved, meet often, and try to help each other,” Jimmy Camp, P.E., M.ASCE, a bridge engineering manager at Maricopa County Department of Transportation said. “It is a very collaborative effort that needs to take place; otherwise, it&#8217;s just not going to happen with some of these newer technologies.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/bridge-in-maricopa-county-az-repaired-with-innovative-fiber-reinforced-concrete-materials/\">Bridge in Maricopa County (AZ) Repaired with Innovative Fiber-reinforced Concrete Materials</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"
