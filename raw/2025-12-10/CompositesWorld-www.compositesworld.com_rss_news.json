The initiative is part of the objectives of the European Green Deal, which aims for cleaner aviation with lower emissions by 2050.</p>\n\n<p>As a final validation of all of the project&rsquo;s developments, Aimen led the manufacture of a composite-reinforced epoxy outlet guide vane (OGV) demonstrator &mdash;&nbsp;a key component in aerospace turbines&nbsp;responsible for guiding airflow,&nbsp;contributing to engine efficiency and providing structural support for the engine to the aircraft body. The OGV&rsquo;s&nbsp;development combined automated dry carbon fiber&nbsp;lamination and resin transfer molding (RTM), processes in which a real-time quality control system was also integrated to prevent defects. This technological combination resulted in an OGV component that&nbsp;offers ~35% reduction in weight and up to 80% reduction in manufacturing defects,</p>\n\n<p>These results represent an important step toward&nbsp;the intelligent manufacture of aerospace composite structures, where automation, digitization and advanced materials combine to drive a more sustainable industry without compromising performance or safety.</p>\n\n<p>In recognition of its work, CAELESTIS has been selected as one of three finalists in the&nbsp;JEC World 2026 Innovation Awards in the &ldquo;Digital Manufacturing, AI &amp; Data&rdquo; category, an important awards in the field of composites worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>CAELESTIS is funded by the European Union and brings together partners specializing in aeronautics, advanced simulation, composites, automated manufacturing and digital technologies.&nbsp;</p>"

Laminates can also be configured to include integrated functionalities, such as lightning strike protection and galvanic corrosion protection, bringing further processing and functional benefits.</p>\n\n<p>With FAA-accepted, statistically validated material property data now publicly available, customers are able to&nbsp;leverage NCAMP material, process specification&nbsp;and design allowables to accelerate aircraft structural design and certification.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Adding our fabric-based Toray Cetex&nbsp;TC1225 material to the NCAMP database reflects Toray&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to advancing TPC&nbsp;and adoption of these materials across the aerospace supply chain,&rdquo; notes Scott Unger, CEO of Toray Advanced Composites. &ldquo;This milestone will be further strengthened by NCAMP qualifications on additional Cetex product types, which are expected to be finalized in the near future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Toray continues to expand its NCAMP-qualified portfolio, with resin-rich surface configurations of TC1225/T700 and TC1225/T1100 unidirectional tapes material qualifications in process. According to the company, these developments&nbsp;will deliver even greater processing flexibility for manufacturers to create structural&nbsp;components using a wide range of processing methods. Data for these two material types is expected to be available in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>Toray Cetex&nbsp;TC1225 is a semi-crystalline low-melt PAEK resin system known for its optimal mechanical properties and proven success for primary to secondary structures within the aerospace industry. The distinctive value of Toray Cetex&nbsp;TC1225 over other composites with a PAEK family matrix is its processability, vacuum bag only performance&nbsp;and suitability for a wide range of thermoplastic production methods.

It offers industry access to pre-commercial-scale production and testing, as well as expertise in hydrocarbon processing and carbon fiber&nbsp;development. </p>\n\n<p>Carbon fiber&nbsp;is made with petroleum-based products that are exported, but its price is currently prohibitive. Alberta Innovate believes that a version derived from&nbsp;Canadian bitumen has the potential to reduce the cost of carbon fiber&nbsp;production, and as a result, unlock new applications for its use.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At Alberta Innovates, we don&rsquo;t just see carbon fiber&nbsp;as a material &mdash;&nbsp;we see it as a catalyst,&rdquo; says Alberta Innovates CEO Mike Mahon. &ldquo;A conduit for cleaner energy, smarter design and resilient systems. It&rsquo;s where science meets sustainability.&rdquo; By using bitumen for high-value applications, Alberta has the potential to expand the material&rsquo;s opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The facility&rsquo;s first clients will be the <a href=\"https://albertainnovates.ca/funding/carbon-fibre-grand-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">finalists of the Alberta Innovates Carbon Fibre Grand Challenge</a> (CFGC), a $20 million competition to accelerate the development of production for carbon fiber&nbsp;from bitumen-derived feedstocks and promote their use in manufactured products.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of the main challenges innovation faces is the gap between laboratory research and commercialization, often due to the lack of pilot-scale infrastructure,&rdquo; says Yasmine Abdin, president and COO, Fibernx, a BC-based carbon fiber&nbsp;company that will be relocating to Alberta to be one of the facility&rsquo;s first clients. &ldquo;This facility allows us to validate our current manufacturing processes on a larger scale and identify the adjustments needed for real-life production. It serves as the vital link between research and manufacturing, to enable faster commercialization of carbon fiber technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>For more info on the facility, <a href=\"https://albertainnovates.ca/alberta-carbon-fibre-processing-facility/\" target=\"_blank\">visit this link</a>.</p>"

Contacted&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deproductenmakers.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">De Productenmakers</a>&nbsp;(Eindhoven), Royal3D&rsquo;s task was to adapt the inlet design to the 3D printing manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-DAC-inlet-3Dprinted-min.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"3D printed DAC inlets.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-DAC-inlet-3Dprinted-min.jpeg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Royal3D approached the request using its step-by-step development method, progressing from design, through testing, followed by the actual 3D printing process&nbsp;and finishing with post-processing. First, the team&nbsp;created the parametric production model to ensure adaptability for larger DAC systems in the future without any delay. After the inlet model was ready, Royal3D created&nbsp;a couple of test pieces to validate with De Productenmakers. Followed by its approval, the team produced&nbsp;two inlets for the Carbyon Go unit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the project&rsquo;s challenge was to 3D print an inlet that weighed less than 25 kilograms&nbsp;per unit. The inlet also had to have minimal warping, while still being aesthetically pleasing. Those were the guiding parameters the&nbsp;team had to follow during the 3D printing manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p>The printing process took 12 hours, followed by post-processing with a specialized coating by the Royal3D team.&nbsp;Enhanced with UV additives, the components offer enhanced durability and resistance to sunlight-induced degradation. In&nbsp;line with Royal3D&rsquo;s values and beliefs, the production process was engineered to minimize material waste; any residual material was shredded and recycled back into raw feedstock, ready for reuse in future prints.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Royal3D&rsquo;s experience project, the lead time was within 3 weeks. The project further proves how 3D printing and sustainability can go hand in hand.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>In September 2025, Carbyon&nbsp;launches its first DAC module, Carbyon Go. Its&nbsp;sorbent has a large surface area, reaching 90% CO<sub>₂</sub> saturation in just 100 seconds. It is reported to capture 3 tons of CO<sub>₂</sub> per year and to be 200 than&nbsp;faster than other&nbsp;solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"
