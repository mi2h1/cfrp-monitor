Where existing solutions rely on reflecting radar waves, FibreCoat&rsquo;s&nbsp;thin and flexible radar-absorbing material (RAM)&nbsp;absorbs them. It uses bicomponent multifilament yarn dispersed in composites and is made from carefully engineered blends of PMMA, carbon nanotubes&nbsp;and Alucoat fillers. These are tuned for precise thicknesses (ranging from 0.5-6 millimeters) and for key radar frequency bands such as the X-band (8-12 gigahertz).</p>\n\n<p>The RAM has achieved reflection losses of up to -40 decibels, equivalent to 99.99% radar absorption. In addition, unlike many RAM solutions that degrade at angle,&nbsp;FibreCoat&rsquo;s multilayer composites are reported to maintain performance across curved surfaces and slanted radar exposure. In testing, they have achieved &ge; -10 decibel&nbsp;reflection loss up to 60 degrees&nbsp;in Transverse Electric (TE) mode and up to 45 degrees&nbsp;in Transverse Magnetic (TM) mode.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, where current technologies&nbsp;typically require&nbsp;thick plating or specialized paints, and are narrowband (targeting only a single radar frequency), FibreCoat&rsquo;s solution is lightweight, flexible and broadband: absorbing radar across a wide spectrum of frequencies and outperforming existing materials by up to 100 times.</p>\n\n<p>The fiber-reinforced composite, a type of &ldquo;meta-material,&rdquo;&nbsp;is soon to be commercially available. The company has completed successful laboratory tests and measurements, and expects field testing to be complete this year. FibreCoat may offer the fiber&nbsp;to partners for integration into final products.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Absorption opens up a range of new possibilities,&rdquo; says Dr Robert Br&uuml;ll, CEO of FibreCoat.&nbsp;&ldquo;We expect this fiber-reinforced composite to give the space, defense and automotive sectors more design freedom.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>FibreCoat, founded in Germany in 2020 but developing its materials since 2014, is known for inventing a novel technology to coat metals and plastics onto fibers via a fiber spinning process.&nbsp;FibreCoat&rsquo;s range of products offer strength, conductivity, shielding&nbsp;and recyclability. The company now employs 42 members of staff and has three production sites: Aachen, Germany; Rustavi, Georgia; and Gorlice, Poland.</p>"

This work, titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014812501211X?via%3Dihub\">Performance analysis and geometric optimisation of bladeless wind turbines using wake oscillator model</a>,&rdquo; has been&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<em>Renewable Energy</em>.</p>\n\n<p>According to <em><a href=\"https://acmanet.org/bladeless-wind-turbines-offer-potential-for-efficient-renewable-energy-production/?utm_campaign=11454023-Industry%20Digest%202025&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--C0SskB4gEgmh1IaX4VX9upjyPzilfUslNm5AlXwv1kddjiPICfcdHb1q4J4nIQnkgITbE_Mndpnnm___yxdF1neyG_Q&amp;_hsmi=371201924&amp;utm_content=371201924&amp;utm_source=hs_email\" target=\"_blank\">Composites Manufacturing</a>,</em>&nbsp;BWTs&nbsp;&ldquo;consist of a cylinder built of resin-reinforced carbon fiber or glass fiber that is anchored to the ground by a rod&rdquo; and&nbsp;sways in the wind, like lampposts in inclement weather.&nbsp;As the wind blows against them, BWTs create vortices &mdash;&nbsp;alternating swirls of air that rock the entire structure back and forth.&nbsp;When the frequency of the rocking matches the structure&rsquo;s natural tendency to vibrate, the motion is amplified significantly, and the increased motion is converted into electricity. This process is called&nbsp;vortex-induced vibration.</p>\n\n<p>In its paper, the team shows how they used computer modeling techniques to simulate the performance of thousands of variations of BWT design. The results cast new light on the interplay between mast dimensions, power output&nbsp;and structural safety in winds between 20 and 70 miles per hour.</p>\n\n<p>Key findings include an&nbsp;optimal design for BWTs which creates a &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; that balances power generation with structural strength. The design, a 65-centimeter-diameter, 80-centimeter-tall mast, could safely deliver a maximum of 460 watts of power, significantly outpacing the performance of even the best-performing, real-world prototypes built to date, which have delivered a maximum of 100 watts.</p>\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s&nbsp;model also demonstrated the limits of other designs, which could potentially generate more power, but wouldn&rsquo;t hold up to real-world conditions. In the paper, the University of Glasgow team&nbsp;illustrates&nbsp;how different designs of BWTs could, in theory, generate up to 600 watts, but at the cost of structural integrity.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the team believes their methodology could provide the foundation for scaling up BWTs to utility-grade systems generating 1 kilowatt and beyond, making them much more practical for use by renewable energy providers.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;What this study shows for the first time is that, counter intuitively, the structure with the highest efficiency for extracting energy is&nbsp;not in fact the structure which gives the highest power output,&rdquo; explains the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s James Watt School of Engineering Dr. Wrik Mallik, one of the paper&rsquo;s authors. &ldquo;Instead, we have identified the ideal midpoint between the design variables to maximize the ability of BWTs to generate power while maintaining their structural strength. In the future, BWTs could play an invaluable role in generating wind power in urban environments, where conventional wind turbines are less useful. BWTs are quieter than wind turbines, take up less space, pose less of a threat to wildlife&nbsp;and have fewer moving parts, so they should require less regular maintenance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>James Watt School of Engineering&rsquo;s professor Sondipon Adhikari,&nbsp;also one of the paper&rsquo;s authors, says they hope this research will help spur industry to develop new BWT design prototypes. &ldquo;Removing some of the guesswork involved in refining prototypes could help bring BWTs closer to becoming a more useful part of the world&rsquo;s toolbox for achieving net-zero through renewables,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Adhikari. &ldquo;We plan to continue refining our understanding of BWT design and how the technology can be scaled up to provide power across a wide range of applications. We&rsquo;re also keen to explore how metamaterials &mdash;&nbsp;specially designed materials which have been finely tuned to imbue them with properties not found in nature &mdash;&nbsp;could boost BWTs&rsquo; effectiveness in the years to come.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>James Watt School of Engineering master&rsquo;s student Janis Breen also contributed to the paper.</p>"

Conshohocken, Pa., U.S.) is developing a proposed standard that organizations can use to design, analyze and certify composite structures in the aerospace, automotive, marine and civil engineering fields. The proposed standard (<a href=\"https://www.astm.org/membership-participation/technical-committees/workitems/workitem-wk93387\" target=\"_blank\">WK93387</a>) is being developed by the structural test methods subcommittee&nbsp;(D30.05),&nbsp;ASTM&nbsp;D30.</p>\n\n<p>According to ASTM member Adam J. Sawicki, the proposed standard practice contains procedures to modify the D7264/D7264M polymer matrix composite laminate flexure test method to permit testing of specimens containing open and filled holes.</p>\n\n<p>Sawicki adds that the practical applications of WK93387 (in combination with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astm.org/membership-participation/technical-committees/workitems/workitem-wk93388\" target=\"_blank\">WK93388</a>) center on the generation of open-hole and filled-hole flexure data can be used in the design and analysis of composite structures.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;These tests are performed to complement D5766/D5766M for open-hole tension, D6484/D6484M for open-hole compression&nbsp;and D6742/D6742M for filled-hole tension and compression,&rdquo; says Sawicki. &ldquo;Notched laminate flexure tests typically exhibit higher surface strains at failure than those obtained under in-plane open-hole and filled-hole testing. This higher strain capability helps to design weight-efficient structures.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This effort directly relates to the&nbsp;United Nations Sustainable Development Goal&nbsp;#13 on&nbsp;Climate Action.&nbsp;</p>"
