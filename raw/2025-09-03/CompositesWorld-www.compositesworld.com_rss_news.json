The team, made up of 18 students from Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), secured its eighth victory in the event. The car ran on Bridgestone solar car tires with its Enliten&nbsp;technology, which included belt reinforcement made with Twaron Next&nbsp;supplied by <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/teijin-aramid-bv\" target=\"_blank\">Teijin Aramid</a>&nbsp;(Arnehm, Netherlands). This result highlights the strength of Dutch engineering and the role of advanced materials in enabling next-generation mobility.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>What is Twaron Next?</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.teijinaramid.com/en/products/twaron-next\" target=\"_blank\">Twaron Next</a>&nbsp;is Teijin Aramid&rsquo;s&nbsp;new high-performance para-aramid fiber made using reclaimed aramid. It is manufactured using the same polymer and spinning technology as standard Twaron, ensuring full compatibility with existing specifications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Twaron Next&nbsp;is reported to deliver the same mechanical performance as standard Twaron, enabling more responsible material choices without compromising quality.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our role is to provide materials that enable ideas to come to life, even in demanding conditions,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Hendrik de Zeeuw, chief commercial officer, Teijin Aramid. &ldquo;This challenge shows what can happen when we back the next generation of engineers with sustainable, high-performance solutions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s winning vehicle, <em>Nuna 13</em>, was built with one purpose: efficiency. It weighs just 160 kilograms and runs on a custom-designed, ironless in-wheel motor that achieves 98%&nbsp;operational efficiency. Its asymmetric catamaran shape, developed through 6 months of aerodynamic modeling, was validated through full-scale wind tunnel testing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get a second chance out there,&rdquo; notes Thijmen God, technical manager, Brunel Solar Team. &ldquo;The car has to behave exactly as expected, and that only works if the systems are built to work together from the start.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The design features two vertical fins that help convert side winds into forward motion, improving both speed and stability. The Bridgestone solar car tires with its Enliten&nbsp;technology were reinforced with Teijin Aramid&rsquo;s product, Twaron Next. Twaron&nbsp;was also used in the vehicle&rsquo;s protective driver shield. This version of Twaron&nbsp;contains circular content and has contributed to enhancing the tire&rsquo;s performance and environmental profile. <em>Nuna 13</em> marks&nbsp;the first industrial-scale use of this material&nbsp;in a real-world application.</p>\n\n<p>Teijin Aramid&rsquo;s support of the Brunel Solar Team is part of its broader brand platform, Materializing Ambitions, which highlights real-world stories of engineering transformation across industries and geographies. As part of this initiative, Teijin Aramid has released a three-part documentary series, &ldquo;Building Nuna,&rdquo; capturing the Brunel team&rsquo;s journey from classroom theory to high-performance competition. The full series is <a href=\"https://www.teijinaramid.com/en/buildingnuna#series\" target=\"_blank\">available here</a>.</p>"

The facility will operate alongside Safran Landing Systems&rsquo; existing production plants worldwide in Villeurbanne (France), Walton (U.S.) and Sendayan (Malaysia). Scheduled to begin operations in 2030, the site will enable Safran to achieve gradually an increase in volumes of 25% by 2037.</p>\n\n<p>This 30,000-square-meter facility represents an investment of more than&nbsp;&euro;450 million once fully completed. Equipped with technology and industrial systems specifically developed for this project, the facility will be highly automated and will offer employees a working environment of the highest standards. It will have around 100 highly qualified employees when it opens and will double its workforce at full capacity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>This announcement follows other carbon brake developments made earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.safran-group.com/pressroom/safran-inaugurates-new-industrial-facilities-landing-and-braking-systems-molsheim-france-2025-06-04\" target=\"_blank\">In June</a>, Safran&nbsp;inaugurated&nbsp;new industrial facilities for landing and braking systems in Molsheim, France, an investment that&nbsp;modernized&nbsp;and increased&nbsp;the Alsace site&rsquo;s production and maintenance capacities for landing and braking systems, to keep pace with the increasing production rates of aircraft manufacturers and the growing MRO&nbsp;needs of airlines.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.safran-group.com/pressroom/spirit-airlines-renews-its-partnership-safran-supply-and-mro-its-airbus-a320-wheels-and-carbon-2025-04-10\" target=\"_blank\">In April</a>,&nbsp;Spirit Airlines renewed&nbsp;its partnership with Safran for the supply and MRO of its Airbus A320 wheels and carbon brakes, a&nbsp;contract that covers both the Airbus A320ceo and A320neo in service and more to be delivered in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Safran Landing Systems currently equips 55% of commercial airliners with over 100 seats and supports more than 500 airlines worldwide on a daily basis.&nbsp;Safran carbon brakes are made from&nbsp;carbon-based materials, specifically carbon composites for the disks and pads, which are a blend of carbon fibers and ceramic materials like silicon carbide. Carbon brakes are lighter, more efficient and three times more durable than steel brakes and help operators reduce fuel consumption.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Since energy can account for up to 30% of the cost of manufacturing a carbon brake, the choice of location was dependent on a guarantee of secure access to low-carbon electricity at a stable and competitive price over the long term. The facility, says&nbsp;Olivier Andri&egrave;s, CEO&nbsp;of Safran, &ldquo;ensuring our ability to support our customers, against a backdrop of strong air traffic growth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These new technologies will also enable the plant to achieve zero emissions in support of Safran&rsquo;s environmental commitments.&nbsp;It will use biomethane and low-carbon electricity. As a result, its electricity and gas consumption will be reduced by nearly 30% and water consumption by 80%. In addition, all the heat generated by the carbon production process will be recovered to supply a heating network. Some of the production technologies developed for the plant will also be rolled out at other carbon brake facilities to further enhance competitiveness and sustainability.</p>"

To ensure a smooth transition, Nielsen will continue as an advisor to Felix Henseler and Vestas until end of 2025.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The energy industry is impacted by the geopolitical shifts we&rsquo;re seeing across the globe, and our ability to become even more efficient, competitive and scalable will be decisive to ensure affordable, secure and sustainable energy across the globe,&rdquo; says Henseler.&nbsp;&ldquo;With a long career within engineering and manufacturing, efficiency, competitiveness and scalability will be my focus. I&rsquo;m honored to become part of Vestas and meet my many new colleagues who are driving these efforts and ensuring&nbsp;we deliver on our customer promises.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>According to Nielsen, &ldquo;The last 6&nbsp;years have been some of the most eventful and valuable of my career where we have faced many challenges and I&rsquo;m proud of what we have achieved together during that period. I want to thank my many Vestas colleagues, including everyone in executive management, for the support and valuable discussions through ups and downs. I look forward to working with Felix and the rest of the technology and operations management team to ensure a smooth transition.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Vestas&rsquo; Technology and Manufacturing organizations were merged into Vestas Technology and Operations in Q3 2024 with a clear objective to increase industrialization within wind energy and strengthen Vestas&rsquo; end-to-end approach to delivery of wind energy solutions. Vestas seeks to continue this strategic evolution with the appointment of Henseler. He will be part of Vestas executive management and report directly to Henrik Andersen.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Teijin Aramid announces CEO leadership transition</h3>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0825-cw-peoplenews-TeijinAramid-PeterterHorst.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </div>\n\n<p>Taiichi Machida (left) and Peter ter Horst (right).</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/teijin-aramid-bv\" target=\"_blank\">Teijin Aramid</a>&nbsp;(Arnhem, Netherlands) announces that Peter ter Horst will step down as CEO&nbsp;at the end of 2025 after 19 years of dedicated service.

Toward this goal, the Pays de la Loire region is granting &euro;500,000 in financial aid, representing one-third of the project&rsquo;s total budget.</p>\n\n<p>The project&rsquo;s first phase (ODDICEA 1, conducted from 2018-2023) enabled Daher to take a major leap forward in Industry 4.0. Co-funded at 40% by the Pays de la Loire region, ODDICEA enabled the company to move from a robotic plant to a connected factory, delivering tangible results: a 10% increase in productivity at connected workstations; energy savings of approximately &euro;10,000 per month; and a 10% reduction in CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions.&nbsp;These results received recognition, notably with the &ldquo;Digital Revolution&rdquo; award at the 2023 Future Enterprise Heroes Ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>The project also strengthened Daher&rsquo;s integration into the local ecosystem through collaboration with organizations such as IRT Jules Verne, an industrial and collaborative research center for manufacturing; and Astree Software, a key partner in the implementation of manufacturing execution systems (MES).</p>\n\n<p>With continued backing, ODDICEA 2 builds on the achievements of the program&rsquo;s first phase, further improving the Daher Nantes site&rsquo;s performance while reducing its carbon footprint. This new phase continues the work of ODDICEA 1, with the internally developed connectivity standard serving as the foundation.</p>\n\n<p>ODDICEA 2 is structured around four main pillars. The first focuses on optimizing energy consumption through a real-time monitoring solution, along with efforts to eliminate carbon-based energy sources from the plant&rsquo;s energy mix. The goal of the remaining three pillars is to enhance the use of industrial data and integrate advanced technologies to increase the site&rsquo;s competitiveness. ODDICEA 2 also will benefit other Daher sites, with methods and tools that can be rolled out group-wide.</p>"

The achievement builds on Joby&rsquo;s momentum toward&nbsp;commercial market readiness, acting as a&nbsp;critical measure of the company&rsquo;s product maturity, as well as demonstrating&nbsp;the type of real-world service Joby intends to offer to the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Joby&rsquo;s flight time from OAR to MRY was approximately 12 minutes over 10 nautical miles, including 5 minutes in a hold pattern at MRY for air traffic spacing. The piloted flight included vertical takeoff, transition to wingborne flight, integration into the controlled airspace around MRY&nbsp;and vertical landing. The milestone marks the first time a piloted Joby eVTOL&nbsp;air taxi has flown from one public airport to another. The flight also successfully demonstrated the team&rsquo;s ability to conduct mobile flight tests and deliver full ground support operations away from home base in Marina.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For years, our flight testing has validated our aircraft&rsquo;s capabilities, and we&rsquo;ve done this across a wide range of environmental conditions,&rdquo; notes Didier Papadopoulos, president of aircraft OEM at Joby. &ldquo;As part of the natural progression of our flight test program, it was time to venture further.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These critical flight tests also provided developmental data related to the human factors of operating the aircraft at a controlled airport and in the enroute national airspace. In particular, Joby&rsquo;s ability to integrate into controlled airspace was demonstrated when its aircraft successfully sequenced with other aircraft at Monterey Airport, including a holding pattern to accommodate another arriving airliner. This is also an important step in the company&rsquo;s certification efforts, as the FAA requires aircraft to demonstrate they can operate in shared airspace by flying between multiple airports.</p>\n\n<p>Video of the flight demonstration can be viewed below.</p>\n\n<div></div>"
