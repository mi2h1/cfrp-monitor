The benefits using CFRP\ncomposites are due to their lightweight, high stiffness, as well as corrosion\nresistance. For this reason, there is a fast growing trend in using CFRP\ncomposites for aircraft and wind turbine structural applications. The\nreplacement of the conventional aerospace-grade metal alloys (aluminum,\ntitanium, magnesium, etc.) with CFRP composites results in new challenges. For\nexample, an aircraft during flight is prone to be struck by lightning. To\nwithstand the injection of such massive amount of energy, adequate electrical\nproperties, mainly electrical conductivity, is required. In fact, electrical\nconductance (or its reciprocal, resistance) is a critical parameter\nrepresenting any material change and it can be considered an index for health\nmonitoring. In this paper, AS4/8552 carbon/epoxy laminated composites were\ninjected with two types of electrical currents, impulse current and direct\ncurrent. The change in measured electrical resistance was recorded. A\nsignificant resistance drop occurred after electrical current injections.\nFurthermore, four-point flexural tests were performed on these composites to\ncorrelate an electrical resistance change with a potential flexural property\nchange. There was no clear trend between a resistance change and flexural\nstrength/modulus change of the test coupons, regardless of current injection.\nHowever, it was observed that the injection of the current affects the contact\nresistance such that its resistance decreases.",

We consider the Miura-Ori\nstructures our target model due to their collapsibility and negative Poisson's\nratio (NPR) effects, which are widely used in shock absorbers, disaster\nshelters, aerospace applications, etc. Traditional Miura-Ori structures are\nmade of isotropic materials (Aluminum, Acrylic), whose mechanical properties\nlike stiffness and NPR are well understood. However, how these responses are\naffected by directional materials, like Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)\ncomposites, lacks in-depth understanding. To that end, we study how fiber\ndirections and arrangements in CFRP composites and Miura-Ori's geometric\nparameters control the stiffness and NPR of such structures. Through finite\nelement analysis, we show that Miura-Ori structures made of CFRP composites can\nachieve higher stiffness and Poisson's ratio values than those made of an\nisotropic material like Aluminum. Then through regression analysis, we\nestablish the relationship between different geometric parameters and the\ncorresponding mechanical responses, which is further utilized to discover the\nMiura-Ori structure's optimal shape. We also show that the shear modulus is a\ndominant parameter that controls the mechanical responses mentioned above among\nthe individual composite material properties within the Miura-Ori structure. We\ndemonstrate that we can optimize the Miura-Ori structure by finding geometric\nand material parameters that result in combined stiffest and most compressible\nstructures. We anticipate our research to be a starting point for designing and\noptimizing more sophisticated origami structures with composite materials\nincorporated.",

Three numerical cases,\nan open-hole single ply lamina under uniaxial tension and an open-hole\ncross-ply laminate under biaxial tension and normal pressure, are studied and\ncompared with traditional reinforced composites with unidirectional fibres. The\nmodelling results show that the stress concentration in both fibre and matrix\nare reduced significantly by the curved fibre placement and the stiffness of\nCFRP composites have been improved.

For\ndetecting the hidden failures two sets of intensity observations are recorded.\nThe first set for the initial state and the second set is captured after\napplying the load. To recover the phase information associated with the two\nstates, the captured intensities have been subjected to an iterative algorithm\nbased on the method of generalized projection."

When juxtaposed with conventional soft\nand compliant robotic systems, HCMs exhibit pronounced rigidity, augmented\nmobility, reproducible repeatability, and an effective design and fabrication\nparadigm. In this research, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing carbon\nfiber reinforced plastic CFRP as the foundational material for an HCM based\nfish robot, herein referred to as CarbonFish. Our objective centers on\nrealizing high frequency undulatory motion, thereby laying the groundwork for\naccelerated aquatic locomotion in subsequent models. We proffer an exhaustive\ndesign and fabrication schema underpinned by mathematical principles.\nPreliminary evaluations of our single actuated CarbonFish have evidenced an\nundulation frequency approaching 10 Hz, suggesting its potential to outperform\nother biologically inspired aquatic entities as well as real fish.",

When juxtaposed with conventional soft\nand compliant robotic systems, HCMs exhibit pronounced rigidity, augmented\nmobility, reproducible repeatability, and an effective design and fabrication\nparadigm. In this research, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing carbon\nfiber reinforced plastic CFRP as the foundational material for an HCM based\nfish robot, herein referred to as CarbonFish. Our objective centers on\nrealizing high frequency undulatory motion, thereby laying the groundwork for\naccelerated aquatic locomotion in subsequent models. We proffer an exhaustive\ndesign and fabrication schema underpinned by mathematical principles.\nPreliminary evaluations of our single actuated CarbonFish have evidenced an\nundulation frequency approaching 10 Hz, suggesting its potential to outperform\nother biologically inspired aquatic entities as well as real fish."

    "summary": "This study introduces a novel self-supervised learning approach for\nvolumetric segmentation of defect indications captured by phased array\nultrasonic testing data from Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs). By\nemploying this self-supervised method, defect segmentation is achieved\nautomatically without the need for labelled training data or examples of\ndefects. The approach has been tested using artificially induced defects,\nincluding back-drilled holes and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) inserts, to\nmimic different defect responses. Additionally, it has been evaluated on\nstepped geometries with varying thickness, demonstrating impressive\ngeneralization across various test scenarios. Minimal preprocessing\nrequirements are needed, with no removal of geometric features or\nTime-Compensated Gain (TCG) necessary for applying the methodology. The model's\nperformance was evaluated for defect detection, in-plane and through-thickness\nlocalisation, as well as defect sizing. All defects were consistently detected\nwith thresholding and different processing steps able to remove false positive\nindications for a 100% detection accuracy. Defect sizing aligns with the\nindustrial standard 6 dB amplitude drop method, with a Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) of 1.41 mm. In-plane and through-thickness localisation yielded\ncomparable results, with MAEs of 0.37 and 0.26 mm, respectively. Visualisations\nare provided to illustrate how this approach can be utilised to generate\ndigital twins of components.",

However, there are two main sources of\ncomplexity in THz spectral measurements that have resulted in reduced accuracy\nand high uncertainty in the determination of coating thicknesses. These factors\ninclude: 1. The need for \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the complex index of\nrefraction of each coating layer, and 2. The complex and polarization-sensitive\nreflectivity of samples with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates.\nIn this paper, we propose a combined hardware and software solution to address\nthese two limitations. We employ the polarimetric version of our Portable\nHAndheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanner and use a novel training model on\ntime-of-flight measurements obtained by sparse deconvolution of the THz\ntime-domain pulses. Our method does not depend on separate measurement of the\nindex of refraction of the coating layers; rather, it relies on a physics-based\nlinear model, trained using a small subset of the sample data. We show that\nthickness measurements with mean square error of about 10 $\\mu$m and accuracy\nof more than 92\\% can be achieved when the useful bandwidth of the scanner is\nlimited to about 1.5 THz using photoconductive antenna emitters and detectors.\nWe show that the anisotropic response of the carbon fiber bundles and the weave\npattern structure of the substrate can significantly influence the accuracy of\nthe coating measurement, and therefore a polarimetric imaging approach should\nbe used for inspection of similar samples.",

    "summary": "The CCAT-prime telescope is a 6-meter aperture, crossed-Dragone telescope,\ndesigned for millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength observations. It will be\nlocated at an altitude of 5600 meters, just below the summit of Cerro\nChajnantor in the high Atacama region of Chile. The telescope's unobscured\noptics deliver a field of view of almost 8 degrees over a large, flat focal\nplane, enabling it to accommodate current and future instrumentation fielding\n>100k diffraction-limited beams for wavelengths less than a millimeter. The\nmount is a novel design with the aluminum-tiled mirrors nested inside the\ntelescope structure. The elevation housing has an integrated shutter that can\nenclose the mirrors, protecting them from inclement weather. The telescope is\ndesigned to co-host multiple instruments over its nominal 15 year lifetime. It\nwill be operated remotely, requiring minimum maintenance and on-site activities\ndue to the harsh working conditions on the mountain. The design utilizes\nnickel-iron alloy (Invar) and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) materials\nin the mirror support structure, achieving a relatively temperature-insensitive\nmount. We discuss requirements, specifications, critical design elements, and\nthe expected performance of the CCAT-prime telescope. The telescope is being\nbuilt by CCAT Observatory, Inc., a corporation formed by an international\npartnership of universities. More information about CCAT and the CCAT-prime\ntelescope can be found at www.ccatobservatory.org.",

Here, we\ndescribe the expansion of AMiBA to a 13-element array with 1.2m antennas\n(AMiBA-13), its subsequent commissioning, and our cluster SZE observing\nprogram. The most important changes compared to AMiBA-7 are (1) array\nre-configuration with baselines ranging from 1.4m to 4.8m covering angular\nscales from 2\\arcmin to 11.5\\arcmin, (2) thirteen new lightweight\ncarbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) 1.2m reflectors, and (3) additional\ncorrelators and six new receivers. From the AMiBA-13 SZE observing program, we\npresent here maps of a subset of twelve clusters. In highlights, we combine\nAMiBA-7 and AMiBA-13 observations of Abell 1689 and perform a joint fitting\nassuming a generalized NFW pressure profile. Our cylindrically integrated\nCompton-y values for this cluster are consistent with the BIMA/OVRA, SZA, and\nPlanck results. We report the first targeted SZE detection towards the\noptically selected galaxy cluster RCS J1447+0828, and we demonstrate the\nability of AMiBA SZE data to serve as a proxy for the total cluster mass.\nFinally, we show that our AMiBA-SZE derived cluster masses are consistent with\nrecent lensing mass measurements in the literature.",
