Toward this goal, the Pays de la Loire region is granting &euro;500,000 in financial aid, representing one-third of the project&rsquo;s total budget.</p>\n\n<p>The project&rsquo;s first phase (ODDICEA 1, conducted from 2018-2023) enabled Daher to take a major leap forward in Industry 4.0. Co-funded at 40% by the Pays de la Loire region, ODDICEA enabled the company to move from a robotic plant to a connected factory, delivering tangible results: a 10% increase in productivity at connected workstations; energy savings of approximately &euro;10,000 per month; and a 10% reduction in CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions.&nbsp;These results received recognition, notably with the &ldquo;Digital Revolution&rdquo; award at the 2023 Future Enterprise Heroes Ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>The project also strengthened Daher&rsquo;s integration into the local ecosystem through collaboration with organizations such as IRT Jules Verne, an industrial and collaborative research center for manufacturing; and Astree Software, a key partner in the implementation of manufacturing execution systems (MES).</p>\n\n<p>With continued backing, ODDICEA 2 builds on the achievements of the program&rsquo;s first phase, further improving the Daher Nantes site&rsquo;s performance while reducing its carbon footprint. This new phase continues the work of ODDICEA 1, with the internally developed connectivity standard serving as the foundation.</p>\n\n<p>ODDICEA 2 is structured around four main pillars. The first focuses on optimizing energy consumption through a real-time monitoring solution, along with efforts to eliminate carbon-based energy sources from the plant&rsquo;s energy mix. The goal of the remaining three pillars is to enhance the use of industrial data and integrate advanced technologies to increase the site&rsquo;s competitiveness. ODDICEA 2 also will benefit other Daher sites, with methods and tools that can be rolled out group-wide.</p>"

The achievement builds on Joby&rsquo;s momentum toward&nbsp;commercial market readiness, acting as a&nbsp;critical measure of the company&rsquo;s product maturity, as well as demonstrating&nbsp;the type of real-world service Joby intends to offer to the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Joby&rsquo;s flight time from OAR to MRY was approximately 12 minutes over 10 nautical miles, including 5 minutes in a hold pattern at MRY for air traffic spacing. The piloted flight included vertical takeoff, transition to wingborne flight, integration into the controlled airspace around MRY&nbsp;and vertical landing. The milestone marks the first time a piloted Joby eVTOL&nbsp;air taxi has flown from one public airport to another. The flight also successfully demonstrated the team&rsquo;s ability to conduct mobile flight tests and deliver full ground support operations away from home base in Marina.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For years, our flight testing has validated our aircraft&rsquo;s capabilities, and we&rsquo;ve done this across a wide range of environmental conditions,&rdquo; notes Didier Papadopoulos, president of aircraft OEM at Joby. &ldquo;As part of the natural progression of our flight test program, it was time to venture further.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These critical flight tests also provided developmental data related to the human factors of operating the aircraft at a controlled airport and in the enroute national airspace. In particular, Joby&rsquo;s ability to integrate into controlled airspace was demonstrated when its aircraft successfully sequenced with other aircraft at Monterey Airport, including a holding pattern to accommodate another arriving airliner. This is also an important step in the company&rsquo;s certification efforts, as the FAA requires aircraft to demonstrate they can operate in shared airspace by flying between multiple airports.</p>\n\n<p>Video of the flight demonstration can be viewed below.</p>\n\n<div></div>"

Supported by Boeing Australia and&nbsp;engineering services company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://memko.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Memko</a> (Melbourne), the university&rsquo;s&nbsp;Centre for Future Materials (CFM) has since innovated a digital twin using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/dassault-sys\" target=\"_blank\">Dassault Syst&egrave;mes</a>&rsquo; (V&eacute;lizy-Villacoublay, France) 3DEXPERIENCE platform to&nbsp;digitize&nbsp;the composite repair process.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;MEMKO brings to UniSQ access to the Dassault Syst&egrave;mes virtual twin software and their engineering expertise with these tools, which enables the virtual replication of a product along its whole life cycle &mdash;&nbsp;from digital design through to manufacturing requirements or in this case, structural repair,&rdquo; says&nbsp;iLAuNCH Trailblazer executive director Darin Lovett.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Tristan Shelley from the UniSQ CFM has been heading the research, with the ultimate goal of increasing the digitalization of manufacturing processes for composite materials. In addition, to complete the project, the&nbsp;UniSQ installed scholarships for three Ph.D. opportunities to work alongside engineers and scientists at Boeing Aerostructures Australia and Memko in Melbourne, Brisbane and Toowoomba in an effort to develop workforce development and upskilling programs.</p>\n\n<p>Almost two years later, the&nbsp;iLAuNCH Trailblazer project&nbsp;has seen much success, which&nbsp;Dassault Syst&egrave;mes&nbsp;has detailed in this customer story <a href=\"https://www.3ds.com/insights/customer-stories/university-southern-queensland-composite-material-repair\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform&rsquo;s digital twin capabilities, Shelley and his team have been doing everything from damage detection and capturing real-time visual data from filament winding to&nbsp;predict and optimize the best wind path, to&nbsp;programming scarfing tool paths, all in the name of&nbsp;eliminating&nbsp;both engineering and laborious processes and creating greater precision in the composite repair process.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are refining the NDT [nondestructive testing] process to help engineers identify the repairs area faster and more precisely,&rdquo; Shelley says in the article. &ldquo;We use reverse engineering capabilities within the&nbsp;3DEXPERIENCE platform to read the processed NDT data. This enables the creation of topology (the properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations) which in turn can be overlaid with actual CAD data. This allows us to analyze and improve the visibility of internal layers to identify the size and extent of the damage.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.3ds.com/insights/customer-stories/university-southern-queensland-composite-material-repair\" target=\"_blank\">Read the original article</a> for more details about the project&rsquo;s process, successes and next steps.</p>"

Source | FACC Bartsch</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the first half of 2025,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facc.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">FACC</a>&nbsp;(Ried im Innkreis, Austria) reports it was able to achieve a&nbsp;10.6% increase in revenue to &euro;484.7 million (same period in 2024: &euro;438.3 million) despite a still challenging global environment.</p>\n\n<p>All divisions of FACC (Aerostructures, Cabin Interiors, and Engines and Nacelles)&nbsp;reported a positive EBIT in the first half of 2025. Group EBIT of &euro;18.4 million is in line with management's expectations and is burdened by disruptions in international supply chains as well as high material and personnel costs (same period in 2024: &euro;22.5 million). Compared to the previous year, the number of employees increased by 123 employees (FTE).</p>\n\n<p>Overall, growth of the aviation industry continued in the first half of the year. While short-term adjustments took place in the market for passenger aircraft &mdash; which were affected by supply chain problems in the engine sector&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;FACC was able to benefit from the sustained positive development of the business jet market in part due to the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;diverse product strategy. The long-term growth of the whole industry is illustrated by a worldwide record order backlog of more than&nbsp;17,500 passenger aircraft ordered. This is also reflected in FACC&rsquo;s order backlog, which rose to more than $6 billion in the first half of 2025 with new orders and rate increases.</p>\n\n<p>FACC&rsquo;s&nbsp;global production and sales network of 15 international locations in Europe, the U.S. and Asia provides it with a high level of resilience given the current geopolitical challenges. With the strengthening of the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/facc-agreements-with-rolls-royce-tata-and-kineco-expand-its-global-backlog-footprint-in-india-\" target=\"_blank\">supply chain in India</a>, relocation of production of the COMAC C919 product range (structural and interior systems) to China, and an increase in operating performance at the FACC plants in Croatia/Jakovlje and in Canada/Montreal, this location strategy could be further advanced in the first half of 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s cost reduction and efficiency program, which has been in place since October 2024, is already showing results. This is illustrated by FACC&rsquo;s increase in revenue with around the same&nbsp;number of employees since the end of FACC&rsquo;s&nbsp;2024 financial year. In addition, the focus in the first half of 2025 was on optimizing the supply chain and reducing material inventories. These have been significantly reduced since the end of Q3 2024, thereby contributing to an improvement in cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>When considering its outlook for the duration of 2025, FACC expects to see around&nbsp;5 billion passengers in the aerospace industry&nbsp;for the first time. Airlines&rsquo; demand for efficient and modern aircraft remains high, and despite ongoing supply chain challenges, all major aircraft manufacturers are confirming their targets for the entire 2025 financial year at the end of the first half of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the current market situation for 2025, FACC management expects growth to continue and has specified its outlook at the half-year mark at around &euro;1 billion in group revenue, which corresponds to a revenue growth of more than 10% compared to the previous year. The EBIT margin will continue to improve compared to 2024 due to effects from FACC&rsquo;s efficiency improvement program currently being implemented (2024: 3.2%).</p>"

The flight took place at Archer&rsquo;s flight test facility in Salinas, California, in front of United Airlines&rsquo; CTO, Mike Leskinen, who led United Airlines&rsquo; early investment in Archer.</p>\n\n<p>Test flights in the preceding week reached speeds of nearly 150 miles per hour over a variety of patterns. This latest achievement marks another milestone in Archer&rsquo;s envelope expansion program as the company advances toward Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)&nbsp;certification in the U.S. and near-term commercialization in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>\n\n<p>The flight was conducted as a conventional takeoff and landing mission. Four of Archer&rsquo;s test pilots are now regularly conducting test flights in <em>Midnight</em>, underscoring the program&rsquo;s continued progress and maturity.</p>\n\n<p>According to Adam Goldstein, Archer&rsquo;s founder and CEO, &ldquo;Crossing the 50-mile mark at speed is another clear step toward commercialization that shows the maturity of our program.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The experimental test pilot for this flight noted that throughout the 30-minute flight, the aircraft performed consistently, with predictable handling. <em>Midnight&nbsp;</em>flight test pilots will continue to expand speed and duration, and test mission profiles that map to early commercial operations.&nbsp;</p>"

Source | Continuous&nbsp;Composites</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>On Aug. 15, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/continuous-composites\" target=\"_blank\">Continuous Composites</a> (CCI, Coeur d&rsquo;Alene, Idaho, U.S.) was awarded a $1.9 million&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sbir.gov/awards/214571\" target=\"_blank\">Tactical Funding Increase (TACFI)</a>&nbsp;contract from the U.S. Air Force to develop a finite element analysis (FEA) tool for Continuous Fiber 3D Printing (CF3D). This contract, which started in November 2024, will run through August 2026, and represents an advancement in the simulation of anisotropic composite materials.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, commercially available FEA solutions are limited to isotropic materials, such as metals, where strength and stress responses are uniform in all directions. However,&nbsp;CF3D&nbsp;composites are anisotropic, with primary strength in the direction of the fibers. This creates a challenge for traditional FEA software, which cannot accurately predict material behavior based on fiber orientation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re solving a major gap in FEA simulation tools,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Steve Starner, CEO of Continuous Composites. &ldquo;Existing software only assigns a single directional property to each layer of composite material, but CF3D&rsquo;s fiber steering requires a more dynamic approach. Our new tool will accurately simulate how our parts will behave under various conditions, which is crucial for industries like aerospace and defense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>CCI is partnering with&nbsp;industry experts&nbsp;on the development of this FEA tool. It will reportedly ingest CF3D toolpath data to generate mesh representations that more accurately reflect fiber orientation, material behavior&nbsp;and structural performance of how anisotropic parts will react to real-world loads.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>What is CF3D?</h3>\n\n<p>Continuous Composites&rsquo;&nbsp;CF3D technology&nbsp;is&nbsp;a 3D printing process that combines continuous fiber reinforcement with thermoset&nbsp;resins and robotic automation to create strong, lightweight composite parts.&nbsp;It uses a continuous dry fiber that is impregnated with a resin, and then cured with UV light, enabling the creation of complex geometries and the embedding of sensors or circuits.&nbsp;This technology aims to disrupt traditional composites manufacturing by offering a more efficient and cost-effective way to produce high-performance parts, particularly in industries like aerospace and defense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/commercializing-uv-curable-thermosets-for-continuous-fiber-3d-printing\">Commercializing UV-curable thermosets for continuous fiber 3D printing</a>&rdquo; for more info.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>As part of this effort, CCI will integrate the new tool into&nbsp;CF3D Studio, enabling the prediction of material properties and performance before physical testing begins. This capability is expected to dramatically reduce development time and increase reliability in the design of complex composite parts used in mission-critical applications.</p>\n\n<p>This contract is a milestone for Continuous Composites, advancing CF3D technology from a manufacturing process to a comprehensive design-to-performance solution.&nbsp;</p>"
