The standard received official approval from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) on April 29, 2025, with the final action recorded in the May 9, 2025, edition of ANSI<a href=\"https://acmanet-my.sharepoint.com/personal/shilaski_acmanet_org/Documents/Documents/ACMA%20Standards/Press%20Releases/Standards%20Action\"><em>Standards Action</em></a> (VOL. 56, NO. 19).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comprehensive manual remains a vital tool for engineers, architects, and designers working with fiberglass reinforced polymer (FRP) grating. It offers essential technical data including performance-based load tables, manufacturing tolerances, and ordering guidance to support effective specification and design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FRP grating has been used for more than half a century and continues to gain traction due to its durability and adaptability. Unlike traditional materials such as metal, FRP grating resists corrosion, weighs less, and offers superior strength-to-weight ratios. It also provides non-conductive properties and long-lasting color integration, making it ideal for use in harsh or demanding environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key distinction in FRP design is its emphasis on serviceability—specifically deflection limits—over strength as the primary criterion for safety and performance. This design approach results in higher safety margins, providing engineers and facility managers with greater confidence in critical applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reaffirmed <em>FRP Composites Grating Manual for Pultruded and Molded Grating and Stair Treads</em> is available now for purchase in both digital and print formats via the <a href=\"https://my.acmanet.org/nc__store?category=a0L5w00000EeQvYEAV\">ACMA web store</a>.

Tras Ltd used the prepregs in the development of final components for the vehicle body after extensive testing. Not only are the prepreg materials lightweight and sustainable, but they also provide a unique and natural look to the body of the HiLux.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sustainability was important to the team, and Bcomp&#8217;s flax fiber technologies offer up to 85% lower CO₂ footprint when compared to traditional carbon fiber parts. Not only is the flax fiber material ecologically sound, the components developed of the material performed well in crash testing and provided excellent vibration damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Masanao Nitta, CEO of Tras Ltd. noted about the development of the components for the body of the HiLux, “The use of the special resin system was an important improvement for us, as we often face very high humidity in Asia, yet the components must still meet the rigorous demands of racing. With this natural car body, we now have a lightweight, sustainable component that looks great too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A major challenge was the comparatively high moisture absorption of the flax fibers. We therefore used a special transparent, fast-curing resin system that has proven particularly resistant to and tolerant of the high moisture content of the natural fibers. This ensures an attractive appearance of the components as well as the good mechanical and thermal properties of the composite material, which are particularly important in motorsports,” explains Dr. Thomas Meinhardt, Team Lead Technical Marketing Prepregs at SGL Carbon. Toyota subsidiary TCD (Toyota Customizing &amp; Development) has followed this project and is interested in exploring the use of natural fibers in future developments.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/body-of-toyota-hilux-built-using-sgl-carbon-prepregs/\">Body of Toyota HiLux Built Using SGL Carbon Prepregs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

In partnership with Exel Composites, the companies created and installed custom-made composite collector pipes that improved borehole energy efficiency by 10%. The pipes also meet the plant’s focus on durability, sustainability, and recyclability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collector pipes are installed two kilometers underground, so they must be able to withstand their own weight as well as provide insulation to minimize heat loss during energy transfer. Traditional materials were ruled out as metal conducts heat and plastic does not have the necessary mechanical strength required at the depths of this project. Exel designed and manufactured the metal-free pipes using fiberglass in a pultrusion process, optimizing the material for insulation and flow. QHeat installed the pipes using specialized tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our core expertise is in understanding what composites can enable. While they offer general benefits like durability and lightness, we focus on identifying what’s required in each unique case and solving those needs with the right combination,” says Tiina Uotila, Technical Sales Manager at Exel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We got to work ambitiously and openly on a product that has the potential to launch us into new business areas and markets. We could demonstrate that the composite pipes have an estimated 50-year lifecycle and can be responsibly disposed of at the end of it,” said Pertti Kainu, Product Business Owner at Exel Composites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think we all take our hats off to QHeat for developing their technology and a functional system, as well as having excellent references and diverse expertise. It’s not self-evident to be able to drill two kilometers into the bedrock,” Kainu added.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/qheat-and-exel-composites-improve-efficiency-in-energy-plant-with-composite-collector-pipes/\">QHeat and Exel Composites Improve Efficiency in Energy Plant with Composite Collector Pipes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Skyfly’s Axe prototype eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-off and Landing) aircraft successfully flew between two airfields and back again, a first in European flight. Skyfly’s Chief Technical Officer, Dr. William Brooks, piloted the flight of the Vertically-Capable Aircraft (VCA) from Turweston Aerodrome in Northamptonshire to Bicester Airfield in Oxfordshire, and back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test program of the Axe has been focused on validation of the craft’s airframe and control systems in wing-borne flight. The latest test demonstrated the VCA’s capability to take off and land vertically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way some aerodynamic features of the canard wing have been fine-tuned, but the fundamental original design of the aircraft has met and exceeded expectations throughout the testing phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes the Axe special is its ability to operate as a traditional airplane in forward flight. The Axe can take off vertically and the design of the main wing and a canard wing allow normal forward flying operation in flight. The wings improve the range of the aircraft as well. Mechanical control links to control surfaces do not rely on any electrical system, enabling the ability to glide and land in the event of system failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweighting was a focus of the design team and was achieved – the Axe weighs just 750 kg thanks to the use of carbon fiber composite materials throughout the entire structure of the aircraft. The Axe also reduced weight and cut operating costs by eliminating rotating engines and wings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Skyfly earned permission from the UK Civil Aviation Authority to move forward with conventional fixed-wing flying, then to conduct airborne transitions between vertical and wing-borne flight. With this step behind them, the Skyfly team is moving into testing the full transition phase. The next Axe prototype will feature two electric motors on each of the four wingtips. Each motor will be encased in a single nacelle and will be powered by swapable and removable lithium batteries housed in the fuselage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Brooks commented, “The aircraft performed very well. It has a gentle feel in turbulence, giving the impression of more span because of the motor masses at the tips. The comfort, outstanding view and lack of noise make for enjoyable flying.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skyfly plans for the first deliveries of the Axe in 2026.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/skyfly-completes-europes-first-evtol-flight-between-airfields/\">Skyfly Completes Europe’s First eVTOL Flight Between Airfields</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

The new 36 Molokai, available in October 2025, is the next generation of fishing vessels, built for those who want comfort while they fish for the big catch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 36 Molokai is based on Aquila’s highly successful 47 Molokai. 47 Molokai was designed in partnership with Peart Yacht Design and provides luxury catamaran comfort with durability and offshore fishing capabilities. Molokai 36 is also being developed in collaboration with Pearl with a focus on an efficient hull, a strategically designed deck layout, and the strength and structure to withstand the challenges posed by the sea and by big fish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of particular interest is the 36 Molokai&#8217;s carbon fiber hardtop. Hardtops have traditionally been built of fiberglass which may require additional reinforcement. The new carbon fiber hardtop is rigid and strong,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>allowing stress to be distributed evenly across the structure. Even with the installation of heavy towers with antennas, outriggers, and electronics, the hardtop, built of advanced composite materials, stays strong and durable without added structural reinforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catamaran is also designed for comfort with 3 bow sun loungers, optional storage features, a summer kitchen, an integrated tackle station, a sleeping cabin, and a private head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t set out to build just another 36-foot boat,&#8221; said Jean Raas, CEO of Aquila USA and Chief Product Officer. &#8220;We built a fishing weapon that happens to be 36 feet long. Every design decision was made with serious anglers in mind. The beautiful thing is it&#8217;s also a great boat for entertaining family and friends.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/aquila-catamaran-built-with-carbon-fiber-for-hardcore-fishing/\">Aquila Catamaran Built with Carbon Fiber for Hardcore Fishing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Wind energy is celebrated for its sustainability and effectiveness, but there are concerns about recycling wind blades and about the space required for wind turbines and wind farms, especially in urban areas. Researchers from the University of Glasgow’s James Watt School of Engineering used computer simulations to explore how Bladeless Wind Turbines (BWTs) could be built for maximum efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BWTs consist of a cylinder built of resin-reinforced carbon fiber or glass fiber that is anchored to the ground by a rod. Traditional wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the moving blades into electricity. In comparison, BWTs generate power by vortex-induced vibration – a process where the cylinder oscillates when the wind hits it and the movement of the cylinder generates mechanical energy that is then transformed into electric energy by a generator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team at the University of Glasgow discovered an optimal design for BWTs where power generation is maximized against structural strength. After assessing a variety of structures, the engineers determined the ideal BWT consisted of an 80cm mast which is 65cm in diameter. To date, prototypes delivered a maximum of 100 watts of power and the simulation of the ideal BWT delivered a maximum of 460 watts of power. Once scaled up to utility grade systems, the BWTs could generate 1 kilowatt or more, making them a practical alternative for renewable energy systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Wrik Mallik, Lecturer in Aerospace Engineering at the university and researcher on the project, said, “What this study shows for the first time is that, counterintuitively, the structure with the highest efficiency for extracting energy is not in fact the structure which gives the highest power output. Instead, we have identified the ideal midpoint between the design variables to maximize the ability of BWTs to generate power while maintaining their structural strength.”<br />&nbsp;<br />The James Watt School of Engineering’s Professor Sondipon Adhikari, another researcher on the project, added, “We hope that this research will help spur industry to develop new prototypes of BWT designs by clearly demonstrating the most efficient design. Removing some of the guesswork involved in refining prototypes could help bring BWTs closer to becoming a more useful part of the world’s toolbox for achieving net-zero through renewables.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/bladeless-wind-turbines-offer-potential-for-efficient-renewable-energy-production/\">Bladeless Wind Turbines Offer Potential for Efficient, Renewable Energy Production</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

Lee joined NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) materials research engineer Edwin Chan to discover how this is possible. The result of the research led to the development of an advanced material based on the Bouligand structures of the exoskeleton of these amazing creatures that is tough enough to withstand challenging aerospace applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers synthesized the structures from cellulose nanocrystals found in plant fibers and the nanocrystals assembled into plates and layered on top of each other forming synthetic Bouligand structures. Using high-frequency sound waves, the researchers modified the crystals then formed them into thin films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The films were tested using high-intensity lasers to fire microprojectiles made of silica. The microprojectiles can leave indentations but can also bounce back depending on how the energy spreads in shockwaves after impact. By making the nanocrystals thicker, the films redirected the shockwaves from the impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chan explained, “The results and insights of this research mark an important advance in bioinspired materials design with applications for aerospace, such as helping spacecraft survive the impact of micrometeoroids and protecting orbiting satellites that collide with debris.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team sees future uses of the bioinspired material in applications such as blast-resistant building materials, bullet-resistant glass, protective helmets, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These findings suggest that there are different ways to design materials to absorb impact, and we can use this knowledge to create more resilient and longer-lasting materials,” said Chan. “If you’re a boxer in the ring, you want to fight nine rounds, not just one.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/nist-researchers-develop-advanced-material-based-on-exoskeleton-of-mantis-shrimp/\">NIST Researchers Develop Advanced Material Based on Exoskeleton of Mantis Shrimp</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

These estimates are essential for a wide range of applications, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Emission inventories</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Environmental permit applications</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Regulatory compliance reports</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Internal business planning and sustainability initiatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Participation is open to all interested parties regardless of ACMA membership. ACMA encourages involvement in the standards development process through two key groups:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Relevant Committee</strong> – Responsible for drafting the revised standard and addressing public comments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consensus Body</strong> – Serves as the official voting group that reviews and approves the draft before the final 45-day ANSI public review.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To express interest, individuals must complete the ACMA <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QSFNWXN\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Interest Form</a>. ACMA leadership and the Committee Chair will finalize the composition to ensure balanced representation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on ACMA’s standards development initiatives or to express interest in participation, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.acmanet.org/standards/standards-in-progress/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Standards in Progress</a> page or contact us at <a href=\"mailto:Standards@ACMAnet.org\">Standards@ACMAnet.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Media Contact:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliana White &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Director, Marketing &amp; Communications, ACMA &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>703.665.5208 &nbsp;<br /><a href=\"mailto:ewhite@acmanet.org\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ewhite@acmanet.org</strong></a> &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About ACMA</strong> &nbsp;<br />The <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/about?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8C5gfPlX8M-N1MITtVd68ljceKbuSGw5APqkh6uiRCcOyETmkWfuzRVRrkC4-clopkwHVZ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a> (ACMA) represents the complete North American supply chain for the fiber reinforced polymer (“FRP”) composites industry.
