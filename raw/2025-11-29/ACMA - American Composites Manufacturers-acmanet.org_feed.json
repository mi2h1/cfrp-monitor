With EPDs, manufacturers can clearly communicate the environmental performance of their products, supporting data-driven decision-making and greater confidence among specifiers, designers, and end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Product Category Rule was developed under the guidance of a technical committee of industry experts and subjected to a public comment and review process to ensure transparency, credibility, and alignment with stakeholder and market needs. NSF International functioned as PCR Program Operator for the project. Funding for the PCR development was provided by ACMA’s Composites Growth Initiative Fund, recognizing the critical role EPDs play in accelerating market growth for composite infrastructure materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Completion of the FRP Rebar Product Category Rule is a major milestone for the composites industry,” said Cindy Squires Esq., President &amp; CEO of ACMA. “By providing a consistent framework for measuring and communicating environmental impacts, we are helping FRP rebar manufacturers meet growing market and regulatory demands for transparency, strengthening the case for composites as a sustainable alternative in infrastructure applications.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With EPDs developed under this new PCR, civil/structural engineers, architects, state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other specifying agencies will be able to evaluate environmental impacts alongside cost and performance when selecting rebar materials for reinforced concrete projects. This enables a more holistic assessment of FRP rebar’s benefits, including its durability, corrosion resistance, and contribution to longer service life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2v-g604.na1.hubspotlinks.com%2FCtc%2FW%2B113%2Fd2v-g604%2FVVw1Cw9c1BPQW29sqCB43gJjQW72Qs8N5Gg5vfMmLVSR3m2nnW7Y8-PT6lZ3nxW4J8m1g8H4RqQW8dqL5N96XgBDW1tTBC14hxMv6N2g5GrJp3JDSW30SJtQ8Cnl87W4yGF5M8jzYMPW43PCTz2H17k9W4P9w4Q7LHnnGW4jnW445gNFMqW5ZLr9459HMlFW8nn8cX8pdPN3W3wwVBr6TXJD4W3r8P4p7XNkv5W4wDMP_7J2PtmW5hwWzp1L6GhXW2DwFhR8bxD_PW9hBbgc32brMQW6hbmKZ8_kvFhW75dFBF8z3Y9lW6sqPy_55R86nN5WsYSlvYjtLW9lHxPk9gpbn1W52Ff0D6rnJPtW3D_xx68dp5BvW91hxbd133YZpW2cCqcT1x-csPf5rKyfg04&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cewhite%40acmanet.org%7C5481e6efaa17491cbe7408de2b70bed6%7C98290b1071854ff48f482122732b1551%7C0%7C0%7C638995960424505992%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=cHq2mIIlQ0rqSzt%2F0NoZrqwwmG8NdL68REOEHdf4Djo%3D&amp;reserved=0\">FRP Rebar PCR, NSF-1125-25 Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite Products &#8211; Rebar or Dowel Bars</a></strong>, is now publicly available in the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2v-g604.na1.hubspotlinks.com%2FCtc%2FW%2B113%2Fd2v-g604%2FVVw1Cw9c1BPQW29sqCB43gJjQW72Qs8N5Gg5vfMmLVRl5kBVzW50kH_H6lZ3m8N3npTRHX6P5FW5lRQ573WH7-mN6nB-jrNdXybW43zWcs2q7rxZW2CSqyC6YQ-0hW8ttsb19bblyNW52dFDZ5dT4wyN92VlY9Ld87pVxBYLS7XtkhDW3cfGWs3-lGTpW8zCKVP4fpXkYW8DXVWy3kpYLCVpC92_8hYyQ6W5YJvtj25rKlkW2kTPtt8Tm-qsVkBTZV4ls8cdW73CCnF4gtShvW1ZPC_N5X9KdpW52dy1h654tHjW6GZjpN3hzFP8MQgytBmQplWN4pw64pdKChzW1Rqd5Q6sLr2MW4ggHTK69rpqBVb8hJN8y8L56W6WBV1r7Cwdz6W5MVj362vkCSbW6gXmrr2H5DxjW188CwH4zNZ6nW3H-Mkf6FzPt6V2-45T8pwRXfW7YkYtW7M-ckwf4k7ccP04&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cewhite%40acmanet.org%7C5481e6efaa17491cbe7408de2b70bed6%7C98290b1071854ff48f482122732b1551%7C0%7C0%7C638995960424521895%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=nGxTGFnzrJLhu4pWzPIBZAd64GL6%2F534CLGGlCT9hwE%3D&amp;reserved=0\">ACMA Composites Sustainability Library</a></strong>&nbsp;as well as on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2v-g604.na1.hubspotlinks.com%2FCtc%2FW%2B113%2Fd2v-g604%2FVVw1Cw9c1BPQW29sqCB43gJjQW72Qs8N5Gg5vfMmLVSR3m2nnW7Y8-PT6lZ3llN4bB9F6xnJG0VC-x1T9hZQFmW9c8wXQ4t4ChvW3jhZdj3S2wJYW8Vx12w26XjNfVj4kc-43qv3lW566ZJ28pbndWVkBRlG7S_SghW5fTC4V61qCmjW7w0F2126WdkFW56x6-Y32pB7GW1h91yK369CrVW1LqDLC6dszvWW4cHM3n4vc0fJW4Dx5J04cY-LQW4g1v1F2kJKh_W6jGXwS2GcrPZMFNgv0bsNFXW6ZQzzQ1nN5V1W8SbNJJ4XYRKMW8hGH692TS6p1W4ZM73d8c1Jy5W63hTJJ7BTg5NW3f4nLf7xSNc0W7qVdW52gDGnzW4c-8n143Nq9lf7bN0lx04&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cewhite%40acmanet.org%7C5481e6efaa17491cbe7408de2b70bed6%7C98290b1071854ff48f482122732b1551%7C0%7C0%7C638995960424537297%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xsBpmlPhQVhZHC5xVoSb16xm%2BQd5b%2BrjLctiwUsevhE%3D&amp;reserved=0\">NSF International website</a></strong>, serving as the foundation for EPD development across the industry.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/acma-announces-completion-of-product-category-rule-for-fiber-reinforced-polymer-frp-rebar/\">ACMA Announces Completion of Product Category Rule for Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Rebar</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Transporting large structures into space is both challenging and expensive. With those challenges in mind, a research team at The Grainger College of Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, supported by the Air Force Research Lab, created an efficient method to morph 2D structures into curved 3D structures while in space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For me, the first challenge was to solve the inverse problem,” said aerospace Ph.D. student Ivan Wu, “You have a design for the 3D shape you want, but what is the 2D pattern to print that results in that shape? I had to write mathematical equations to describe the shapes to print the exact pattern. This study solved that problem.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the knowledge that past projects using low energy resulted in shapes with low stiffness – therefore not suitable for aerospace applications – the team implemented a combination of 3D printing and frontal polymerization to eliminate the need for ovens or large autoclaves. Collaborators at the Beckman Institute developed an energy-efficient pure resin system. The resin is molded with a printed carbon fiber design and frozen. To develop the 3D structure, the resin is activated with a heat stimulus that sets the chemical reaction in motion to cure the flat piece into a curved 3D shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Wu, there is more work to be done. He said, “We suggest using the activated 3D shapes as molds to manufacture high stiffness structures in space. You could manufacture the flat gel material with carbon fiber bundles on Earth, transport it into space and activate the shape through a thermal stimulus. But because it’s not rigid enough, you can further use the 3D shape as a mold, adding high-stiffness plies, activate frontal polymerization again and then peel off the high-stiffness composite that is formed to the shape of the initial design. We show in our work that this process can be repeated numerous times without damage to the mold or deviation from the initial morphed shape.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/researchers-developed-a-method-of-morphing-structures-from-2d-into-3d-curved-structures-in-space/\">Researchers Developed a Method of Morphing Structures from 2D into 3D Curved Structures in Space</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

IBHS members are the leading insurance providers for buildings. ACMA members thoroughly impressed the insurance company representatives from the Residential Committee to learn about composites performance in severe climate exposure such as hurricanes and tornadoes, along with performance in fire and impact that composites deliver. The outcome from this education will result in future collaboration between composites and the insurance industry, in both residential and commercial building construction, and potentially standards development and testing of composites products. Member company presentations delivered on demonstrating how composites perform in a variety of applications and showcasing emerging technologies that would impact the building industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past 10 years, the Composites Growth Initiative has conducted over 10+ Composites Technology Days events with target OEMs to educate the engineers and designers about why composites should be selected for their applications. These Tech Days have targeted automotive, aerospace, and defense OEMs, but this event was focused on the insurance industry. It is expected this will be the first of many meetings with the insurance industry to influence how things could be built using composites to address the challenges of destruction resulting from major climate events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/acma-members-impress-the-insurance-institute-on-composites/\">ACMA Members Impress the Insurance Institute on Composites</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

The recognition was for the recent W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam Spillway Gate Replacement Project in Florida. This was a groundbreaking step in the modernization of U.S. water infrastructure. Through this collaboration, ACMA member CMS Infrastructure and other key ACMA members, demonstrated how innovative materials and engineering can extend asset life, reduce maintenance needs, and contribute to long-term sustainability across North America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACMA’s Composites Growth Initiative has been collaborating with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for many years now. This project started with an exploratory mission, led by ACMA’s CGI Staff, to the W.P. Franklin Lock and Dam Spillway in Ft. Myers, Florida at the invitation of Jacksonville District and South Atlantic Division to introduce a team of over 20 ACMA members on the replacement of the components on this spillway with FRP composites. Collaboration with the Inland Navigation Design Center was key to educating USACE engineers on FRP composites. The USACE has mandated the Corps Districts to consider alternative materials such as FRP composites when considering design and facility equipment replacements because of the many benefits that composites bring to applications, most importantly extended service life with minimal maintenance in very aggressive climate and environments that often deteriorate traditional construction materials. Over the past several years, with support of ACMA member companies, ACMA has educated and instructed dozens of USACE engineers, technicians and other field personnel with the Certified Composites Technician (CCT) Program.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/composites-acknowledged-with-innovation-of-the-year-award-by-the-army-corps/\">Composites Acknowledged with Innovation of the Year Award by the Army Corps</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Sicomin developed and introduced SR GreenPoxy 550 &#8211; a sustainable alternative to its line of resins. The new bio-based epoxy system was designed for bonding and lamination of wood composites in yacht construction. SR GreenPoxy 550 was engineered to eliminate harmful substances while meeting or exceeding all properties of the traditional resins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Derived in part from plant sources, SR GreenPoxy 550 reduces reliance on petrochemical raw materials and boasts a clean material safety data sheet. Waste is reduced thanks to excellent viscosity and reactivity for hand lamination processes. Adhesion to wood substrates is enhanced by strength and stiffness at room temperature, and the finish in cured laminates can meet the demands of performance yacht racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SR GreenPoxy 500 was first used by the Greenscow project which focuses on low-carbon alternatives in offshore racing yacht construction. The Greenscow hull built with SR GreenPoxy 500 can reduce the construction footprint by up to 80% when compared with construction of a traditional carbon composite hull while maintaining performance and durability standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We believe SR GreenPoxy 550 is the only bio-based, non-CMR epoxy system for wood composites available on the market today,” said Marc Denjean, Global Sales Manager at Sicomin. “We focused on replicating the best-in-class handling and mechanical properties of our previous resins while delivering a safer, more sustainable system. For our customers, it means the performance they expect with the environmental and HSE profile they need.” “Plywood combined with basalt fiber and SR GreenPoxy 550 resin represents one of the best compromises we’ve seen between performance, durability, repairability and environmental footprint,” said Flavien Gaulard, Director of Kaori Concept, a shipbuilder that integrated SR GreenPoxy 550 into its hand lamination processes. “We’ve tested 550 extensively across different fibers and laminating processes, and its results are on par with traditional resins, with the added benefit of a sustainable chemistry.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/sicomin-launches-sustainable-resin-for-wooden-racing-yachts/\">Sicomin Launches Sustainable Resin for Wooden Racing Yachts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Arianespace launched EUMETSAT&#8217;s Metop-SGA1 (Metop – Second Generation, 1), the first of a series of six polar-orbiting weather satellites, into orbit. EUMETSAT is the European operational satellite agency for monitoring weather, climate, and the environment from space. Beyond Gravity is delivering radio occultation instruments, providing important data for weather forecasts and climate monitoring to all six Airbus-built satellites. The Metop-SGA1 launched on the Ariane 6 rocket, featuring payload fairing from Beyond Gravity made of carbon fiber composite materials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The satellite structures are six-meters high, weigh around one ton, and are built of carbon fiber, aluminum, and titanium. Beyond Gravity provided thermal insulation for the weather satellite, protecting it from extreme temperature fluctuations of plus/minus two hundred degrees Celsius in space, and stabilizing the interior of the satellite at a constant room temperature to ensure safe functioning of the instruments on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This new European weather satellite, together with its five counterparts, will significantly enhance weather forecasting accuracy and climate change monitoring. A key element of this mission is our radio occultation instrument. Our so-called radio occultation instrument provides important weather data, for example about humidity and temperature, and underlines our capabilities as an important data provider,” said Oliver Grassmann, Executive Vice President Satellites at Beyond Gravity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phil Evans, Director-General of EUMETSAT, added “Extreme weather has cost Europe hundreds of billions of euros and tens of thousands of lives over the past 40 years—storms like Boris, Daniel and Hans, record heatwaves and fierce wildfires are just the latest reminders. The launch of Metop-SGA1 is a major step forward in giving national weather services in our member states sharper tools to save lives, protect property, and build resilience against the climate crisis. These positive impacts will be felt even beyond that and over the Atlantic, as Metop-SGA1 is Europe&#8217;s first contribution to the Joint Polar System with NOAA. This milestone reflects years of teamwork across EUMETSAT, ESA, the EU, CNES, DLR, Airbus, Thales Alenia Space, and many others. This is the beginning of an exciting new chapter as we work to ensure the satellite settles into orbit and starts delivering the vital data it was built to provide.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/europes-metop-sga1-orbiting-weather-satellite-launched/\">Europe’s Metop-SGA1 Orbiting Weather Satellite Launched</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"
