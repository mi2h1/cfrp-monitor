The company is already actively selling all over Europe and searching for distribution and partnership opportunities outside the DACH region, where its NDT&amp;E solutions are ideally suited for aerospace, automotive&nbsp;and energy sectors. This strategic move underscores voidsy&rsquo;s commitment to global collaboration and its mission to bring innovation to European industry.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel with its international expansion, voidsy is growing at home. The company has recently welcomed four new team members, strengthening its operational, engineering&nbsp;and business development capabilities. To support this growth, voidsy has also relocated to a larger, state-of-the-art facility in Wels, Austria, equipped for immediate testing of customer samples and continuous innovation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This milestone marks our transformation into a stable, internationally recognized company,&rdquo; says Dr. Holger Plasser, co-founder and CEO of voidsy. &ldquo;We are ready to lead the next wave of innovation in NDT&amp;E.&rdquo;</p>"

It is relevant to many industries for the manufacture of composite structures that are optimized for high performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>ART manufactures high-performance carbon fiber&nbsp;composite parts at rate and with minimal scrap. Lengths of dry composite tape are laid down in rapid and accurate formation, at a speed of up to 2.5 meters/second, in a way that significantly reduces the potential for waste generated by off-cuts that cannot be reused. Up to 95% of the dry tape feedstock used to layer a component goes into the final part.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-Cygnet-McLaren-ART-machine.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"McLaren Automotive and Cygnet Texkimp ART machine.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-Cygnet-McLaren-ART-machine.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>McLaren Automotive and&nbsp;Cygnet Texkimp ART machine.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The solution creates new possibilities for innovation in automotive and aerospace engineering and design through its fiber placement capabilities. This element of the technology enables manufacturers to accurately tailor the load-bearing and stiffness characteristics of the finished part through the strategic positioning of the fibers. Specific adjustment of fiber&nbsp;orientation within the composite material allows for anisotropic stiffness: rigidity can be enhanced in specific directions while flexibility can be maintained elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The process has also been highly automated and digitized to offer extensive handling and real-time monitoring capability. In this way, end users are able to&nbsp;determine that every part has been manufactured to identical specifications, which in turn leads to significant time saving benefits linked to speed of manufacture and reduced test frequency.</p>\n\n<p>A full-scale demonstration machine will be built at Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s Innovation Centre where it will be available for customer trials in early 2026. Within the Centre, organizations will also benefit from Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s tape manufacturing capability which includes advanced machines to manufacture dry carbon fiber&nbsp;tapes alongside high-performance thermoset, thermoplastic and ceramic prepreg materials.</p>"

ExxonMobil worked with <a href=\"https://www.mstrebar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MST Rebar</a> (Ontario, Canada) to develop a new version of Proxxima GFRP&nbsp;rebar. <a href=\"https://www.masonconstruction.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Mason Construction</a>&nbsp;(Beaumont, Texas), a local civil construction team and ExxonMobil partner, handled the installation. The project represents the latest use of Proxxima&nbsp;systems in ExxonMobil&rsquo;s own facilities and operations, in what has become a signature display of confidence in its product.</p>\n\n<p>MST Rebar shipped 40,000 linear feet of material within a 2-week window. &ldquo;We had it in the ground a week later,&rdquo; saya&nbsp;Brian Cavaretta, supervisor for the North Packaging and Shipping Unit at the Mont Belvieu plastics plant. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased with the product and have no intention of going back to steel.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Mont Belvieu plastics plant has proven to be an ideal place to use the distinctive properties of Proxxima GFRP rebar, where a steady traffic of eighteen-wheelers and heavy machinery had resulted in significant wear-and-tear on the existing asphalt and steel-reinforced concrete paving. Additionally, the heavy rainfall of south Texas led to corrosion of the steel, resulting in an excessive amount of time and money spent annually on repairs and replacement.</p>\n\n<p>The MST-Bar&nbsp;created with the Proxxima resin system proved lighter to transport, faster to install and is expected to be more resilient in use. The crew was able to pre-tie the rebar, hand-carry mats and set it in place, without requiring heavy crane equipment, avoiding hot-work sparks.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At first, I was skeptical just like anybody else,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Trey Berry, superintendent at Mason Construction. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s been a very smooth transition going from steel to something new that&rsquo;s a quarter of the weight. All in all, I think it should be the new standard.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>ExxonMobil is expanding use of Proxxima systems-based resins across other applications, including coatings for storage tanks, railcars, subsea pipes&nbsp;and marine vessels. The company is demonstrating opportunities for cost savings, increased productivity&nbsp;and enhanced safety.</p>"

They successfully filled composite tanks with LH<sub>2</sub> produced and stored on-site for the first time at an international airport in preparation for pre-flight testing. This team includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.fabrum.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabrum</a> (Christchurch, New Zealand), developer of zero-emission transition technologies, including composite LH<sub>2</sub> tanks.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.amslaero.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AMSL Aero</a> (Sydney, Australia), developer of the <em>Vertiia</em> H<sub>2</sub>-electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.stralis.aero/\" target=\"_blank\">Stralis Aircraft</a> (Brisbane, Australia), developer of high-performance, low-operating-cost H<sub>2</sub>-electric propulsion systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n<p>Fabrum designed and manufactured the advanced composite LH<sub>2</sub> tanks for the aircraft companies AMSL Aero and Stralis Aircraft. The refueling was successfully completed at Fabrum&rsquo;s dedicated LH<sub>2</sub> test facility at Christchurch Airport, developed in partnership with the airport at its renewable energy precinct.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>More on composites and LH<sub>2</sub> for aviation</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Composites end markets: Pressure vessels (2025)<br />\n\t<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composites-end-markets-pressure-vessels-2025#Aviation%20industry\" target=\"_blank\">Aviation industry&rsquo;s drive for LH<sub>2</sub>, composite tanks</a></li>\n\t<li><em>CW</em>&rsquo;s report on composites in H<sub>2</sub>, including LH<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;cryotanks, cryo-compressed H<sub>2</sub>, Type 3, 4 and 5 tanks and thermoplastic composites. <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/kc/composites-carbon-fiber-hydrogen-storage-report\" target=\"_blank\">Hydrogen Storage Challenges and the Carbon Fiber Opportunity</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>The companies are demonstrating that LH<sub>2</sub> fuel is a credible alternative for the aviation industry. The testing event highlighted several LH<sub>2</sub> technologies &mdash;&nbsp;including Fabrum&rsquo;s triple-skin onboard tanks,&nbsp;featuring what is&nbsp;reported to be &ldquo;groundbreaking&rdquo; composites manufacturing techniques and the culmination of more than 20 years of R&amp;D in cryogenics and composites. Fabrum&rsquo;s LH<sub>2</sub> tank technology provides enhanced thermal insulation and fast refueling compared to conventional double-skin tank designs &mdash; delivering up to 70% faster refueling times and an 80% reduction in boil-off losses.</p>\n\n<p>AMSL Aero will install these tanks on its <em>Vertiia</em> aircraft for long-range flights, enabling it to achieve optimal range, payload&nbsp;and speed. In addition, Stralis Aircraft&rsquo;s lightweight H<sub>2</sub>-electric propulsion system will be powered by LH<sub>2</sub> from Fabrum&rsquo;s cryogenic tanks, which are mounted on the wings of Stralis&rsquo; fixed-wing test aircraft. Stralis expects its H<sub>2</sub>-electric propulsion system will enable travel up to 10 times further than battery-electric alternatives and save 20-50% on operational costs compared to fossil fuel. Its first H<sub>2</sub> test flight is expected to take off in Australasia within 6 months.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our lightweight composite tanks, together with our H<sub>2</sub> liquefier and refueling systems, are critical enablers for H<sub>2</sub>-powered flight,&rdquo; explains Christopher Boyle, managing director of Fabrum. &ldquo;By bringing all the elements together for the first time on-site at an international airport &mdash; producing, storing and dispensing LH<sub>2</sub> into composite aviation tanks as a fuel &mdash; we&rsquo;re proving that LH<sub>2</sub> technologies for aircraft are now available, and that H<sub>2</sub>-electric flight will soon be a reality in Australasia.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, <em>Vertiia</em> was designed to be powered by H<sub>2</sub> for long-range, cargo and passenger operations.&nbsp;&ldquo;It must be as light as possible to achieve its 1,000-kilometer range, 500-kilogram payload and 300 kilometer/hour cruising speed,&rdquo; Dr. Adriano Di Pietro, CEO of AMSL Aero, explains. &ldquo;LH<sub>2</sub> is the lightest zero-emission method of storing energy for long-distance flight; no other technology currently comes close. We often get asked, &lsquo;You are flying <em>Vertiia</em> and are developing an end-to-end H<sub>2</sub> system, but what else needs to happen to make <em>Vertiia</em> fly on LH<sub>2</sub>?&rsquo; With Fabrum&nbsp;we have demonstrated the key steps in that process: from producing LH<sub>2</sub>, to filling our ground transport container, then filling the tanks that we will install to our aircraft before our first LH<sub>2</sub> flights next year. This is a major milestone.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s fantastic to see more of Fabrum&rsquo;s H<sub>2</sub> technologies unveiled and tested,&rdquo; adds Bob Criner, CEO of Stralis Aircraft. &ldquo;We are working with Fabrum to develop onboard tanks for our fixed-wing test aircraft to supply H<sub>2</sub> to our H<sub>2</sub>-electric propulsion system. We&rsquo;re excited to see Fabrum&rsquo;s H<sub>2</sub> fuel dispensing systems for these onboard tanks proven out in testing. This is a vital step toward our first LH<sub>2</sub> test flights.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These H<sub>2</sub> advancements stem from strong industry collaboration aimed at accelerating zero-emission aviation. Fabrum, AMSL Aero&nbsp;and Stralis Aircraft are members of the Hydrogen Flight Alliance in Australia, which is advancing the development of H<sub>2</sub>-electric flight. AMSL Aero was recently awarded a grant from the Australian Government Department of Industry, Cooperative Research Centres Projects (CRC-P) Program for a &ldquo;Liquid Hydrogen Powered Aircraft for Regional and Remote Australia&rdquo;&nbsp;project, with Fabrum among the collaborators. Stralis Aircraft and Fabrum have also received support from Ara Ake, New Zealand&rsquo;s future energy center, to fast-track H<sub>2</sub> technology for Australasia&rsquo;s LH<sub>2</sub>-powered flight.</p>"

A newly developed DLR sensor network provided essential data to determine the precise moment of ignition for the second stage. This &ldquo;sensor cube&rdquo;&nbsp;uses a defined starting position and measures the acceleration and rotation rates in flight to calculate the position of the rocket in space. At the end of its flight, it splashed down safely in a designated and secure area of the Norwegian Sea.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Successful first flight</strong></h3>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the ATHEAt flight experiment, we have succeeded in flying at high Mach numbers for much longer than in our previous projects,&rdquo; says Ali G&uuml;lhan, ATHEAt project manager and head of the Supersonic and Hypersonic Technologies Department at the DLR Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology. &ldquo;We have now reached a new milestone and collected&nbsp;data for further R&amp;D.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This data harvest was made possible by the more than 300 sensors installed by the DLR team into the flight experiment. Also on board were miniaturized, noncontact sensors such as infrared cameras, laser scanners and radiation thermometers. A modular data acquisition system developed by DLR recorded the measurements and transmitted the processed data by radio to ground stations below.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The conditions simulated in the ATHEAt flight experiment are comparable to those that thermal protection systems on future reusable space transport systems will have to reliably withstand during reentry into Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere,&rdquo;&nbsp;explains G&uuml;lhan. The reentry phase, with its extreme aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic conditions, is also a crucial point of development for the space industry. &ldquo;With projects like ATHEAt, we are specifically working on closing this global technology gap.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>DLR combines flight experiments like ATHEAt and its predecessor projects, supported and continuously refined with sophisticated simulations, design processes and component testing on the ground.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>ATHEAt program</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Initiated in January 2022, the ATHEAt program seeks to test key technologies aimed to make future reusable space vehicles more reliable and cost-efficient, with an emphasis on reentry performance. The program is also developing a hybrid rocket booster for use as a future sounding rocket upper stage.</p>\n\n<p>The technologies developed are being tested in ground tests and two space flights. This first flight was structured to test materials, cooling techniques, miniaturized nonintrusive sensors and the aerodynamic properties of the two-stage sounding rocket. The first stage was powered by a Red Kite booster developed by DLR in partnership with Bayern-Chemie, while the second stage was powered by a Canadian-built Black Brant Mark 4 booster.</p>\n\n<p>A second launch, scheduled for 2026 from Esrange Space Center in Sweden, will mark the inaugural flight of the Alduina hybrid rocket booster. Powered by hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), the booster is designed to enable throttleability and reignition while maintaining low system complexity.</p>"
