    "summary": "Achieving damage tolerance in composite materials remains a central challenge\nin materials science. Conventional strategies often rely on filler\nincorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and\nconstrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of\nSpirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical\nfilament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their\nmorphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the\nkey parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions\nexhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield\nstress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl\ncellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in\nbending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture\nsurface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out\n(in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating\nstructure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement\nas a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance\nthrough microstructural architecture.",

      "value": "Achieving damage tolerance in composite materials remains a central challenge\nin materials science. Conventional strategies often rely on filler\nincorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and\nconstrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of\nSpirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical\nfilament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their\nmorphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the\nkey parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions\nexhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield\nstress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl\ncellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in\nbending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture.

    "summary": "This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming\n(DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems\ngoverned by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space\ninto domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic\nprogramming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early\nevolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population\ncooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical\nsymbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all\npopulations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to\nidentify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic\nconstructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided\npruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic\nprogramming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete\n(SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation,\nand 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and\ntest root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed\nstatistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error\ndistributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in\nvalidation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that\ndomain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve\nconvergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable\nmodeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the\nunderlying physical structure.",

    "summary": "Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying\ntemperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and\nreliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment\napplications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage\nmechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at\nambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix\ndebonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading\nresidual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of\nsubsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology,\ninterface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization\nand life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a\nnewly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography\n(FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures\nwith depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography.\nHowever, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and\nlateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of\ndamage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer\nlearning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network\n(IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based\non limited thermographic datasets.",
