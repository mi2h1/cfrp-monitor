This milestone follows an earlier agreement signed in April 2023 by Airbus CEO, Guillaume Faury and the Tianjin Free Trade Zone Investment Co. Ltd. and Aviation Industry Corp. of China Ltd. Preparations to assemble the first aircraft are underway and full operation of the facility is targeted for early 2026.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We welcome the addition of Tianjin&rsquo;s second line to our global production system, as it provides us with the necessary flexibility and capacity to deliver on our plan to assemble 75&nbsp;A320 Family&nbsp;aircraft per month in 2027,&rdquo; says Faury. &ldquo;Over the past 40 years of our presence here in the country, we have come a long way in establishing trustful partnerships with the China civil aviation community, and we look forward to writing the next chapters of our future together.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The FAL line will enable Airbus to significantly increase production close to its customers in China and beyond. It complements the global Airbus production network of 10 FALs &mdash;&nbsp;four in Hamburg (Germany), two in Toulouse (France), two in Mobile, Alabama in the U.S.&nbsp;and two in Tianjin (China). The advanced second line features Airbus&rsquo; latest technologies and processes to produce aircraft worldwide at the same company&rsquo;s highest standards. In addition, the facility takes advantage of electricity from renewable sources, reclaimed water and geothermal energy to support the company&rsquo;s sustainability roadmap, reducing Airbus&rsquo; environmental footprint.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Inaugurated in 2008, the Airbus Tianjin FAL was the first Airbus production line for commercial aircraft outside Europe. It has assembled and delivered more than 780 A320 Family aircraft since then, making the facility a symbol of successful Sino-European cooperation.&nbsp;</p>"

The company&rsquo;s&nbsp;family of thermal protection systems (TPS) can be &ldquo;can be applied to various surfaces, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/structured-air-tps-safeguards-composite-structures\" target=\"_blank\">including carbon fiber composites</a>,&rdquo; according to the company. AeroZero FTB in particular is especially applicable for composite applications in the aerospace and defense industries, including eVTOLS.</p>\n\n<p>With the continuing global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and aerospace electrification, Blueshift&rsquo;s latest addition to its AeroZero&nbsp;family is ideal for a wide range of applications and industries that may&nbsp;experience extreme temperature fluctuations &mdash; from EVs and aerospace markets&nbsp;to marine and rail.</p>\n\n<p>For example, within the field of EVs, FTBs are primarily used as a safety barrier material aimed at preventing the transfer of extreme heat or fire that can result in mechanical damage of battery cells and exposure to high temperatures or discharge events. Blueshift&rsquo;s AeroZero&nbsp;FTBs can withstand exposure up to 1200&deg;C for 30 minutes while&nbsp;maintaining a cold-side temperature below 300&deg;C. This means they may&nbsp;either be used as safety features in preventing uncontrolled fire, for example, due to an aircraft engine fire, or protecting surfaces from direct exposure to flame such as during a rocket takeoff or helping to mitigate the risk of a battery thermal runaway event.</p>\n\n<p>Outperforming traditional mica, silica or polyurethane foams, AeroZero&nbsp;FTBs are up to 80% lighter, with a thickness range of 0.32-1.77 mm &mdash; significantly thinner than conventional barriers (3-10 mm). Alongside this, their ease-of-use and flexibility is a key factor in their application; with their &ldquo;peel-and-stick&rdquo;&nbsp;pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) backing that simplifies installation on irregular surfaces, labor time and cost can be reduced.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Traditional thermal insulators have often been based on polymeric foams or ceramic blankets that can suffer from drawbacks due to their added weight, thickness, toxic off-gassing, lack of flexibility and processing issues,&rdquo; says Tim Burbey, Blueshift president.&nbsp;&ldquo;Available across multiple ranges, we look to incorporate as many vehicles and industries as possible, so everyone can overcome their unique thermal challenges.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The AeroZero&nbsp;FTBs family includes, AZ-FTB 100 for up to 500&deg;C applications; AZ-FTB 101 for up to 800&deg;C; and AZ-FTB 300 for maximum protection up to 1200&deg;C. These advanced FTBs are ideal for protection in EV battery modules, and aerospace components that see indirect and direct exposure to flames.</p>"

The next step will be the opening of a local production facility for composite cores and other high-performance composite parts, aligning with the &ldquo;Make in India&rdquo; initiative.</p>\n\n<p>On this occasion, HindEpsilon&rsquo;s management team was joined by Romain Coullette, Epsilon Composite&rsquo;s sales director, for a celebration in Chennai, followed by meetings with key stakeholders of the Indian power transmission sector, including the Ministry of Power, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Power Grid Corp.&nbsp;of India and several utilities and EPCs.</p>\n\n<p>While Epsilon Cable operates on all continents, India is clearly identified as one of Epsilon Cable&rsquo;s top strategic markets for the future. After being awarded, together with its local standing partners, a series of reconductoring projects in several Indian states such as Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam, Epsilon Cable is moving on with its plan to establish a local factory in India.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;India is one of the most dynamic countries in the world, facing an immense electrification challenge,&rdquo; explains Alexandre Lull, managing director of Epsilon Composite.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced conductors such as HVCRC are recognized as key enablers of this modernization, but the lack of open competition in the field of composite core conductors has hindered the deployment of this technology in the past, so authorities and utilities are actively seeking reliable and competitive suppliers. &ldquo;Epsilon Cable is answering this call with its cost-efficient and sustainable solution, soon to be produced locally in India, bringing additional production capacity and even faster delivery to our&nbsp;local partners,&rdquo; adds Lull. &ldquo;Our mission is fully aligned with India&rsquo;s national grid strengthening plan and in support of India&rsquo;s 500-gigawatt&nbsp;renewable target for 2030.&rdquo;</p>"

However, when thermoset-derived design principles are applied unchanged, AZL believes the processing and performance capabilities of thermoplastics remain largely untapped. AZL&rsquo;s project therefore takes a holistic approach &mdash; TPC-driven vessel designs, manufacturing processes&nbsp;and material configurations to maximize both economic and technical performance.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-l m-r-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Make sure to also check out...</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composites-end-markets-pressure-vessels-2025\">Composites end markets: Pressure vessels (2025)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/market-report-composites-and-carbon-fiber-in-hydrogen-storage\">Market report: Composites and carbon fiber in hydrogen storage</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Dr. Martin Kerschbaum, manager ME22 at TME, highlights the motivation behind Toyota&rsquo;s participation: &ldquo;The usage of thermoplastic resins for manufacturing of high-pressure hydrogen storage vessels is of high interest for Toyota. This is due to potential advantages in terms of design, processing, performance&nbsp;and circularity. It is essential to compare and evaluate the diverse options of design and manufacturing strategies for high-pressure vessels based on TPC materials. Gaining additional insights into the key influencing factors on material efficiency, production scalability and realistic cost-structure scenarios is a crucial part of this process. AZL&rsquo;s structured approach &mdash; a combination of know-how in applications, composite materials and production systems with expertise across the entire value chain &mdash; provides Toyota with valuable input for the further development of innovative storage systems.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The 9-month project brings together international industry partners to explore new TPC vessel concepts. It is structured into three work packages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>WP1: Market &amp; Technology Landscape</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;Mapping state-of-the-art technologies, certification protocols&nbsp;and relevant IP.</li>\n\t<li><strong>WP2: Conceptual Design &amp; Manufacturing Strategies</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;Developing vessel architectures optimized for thermoplastics, evaluating design variants&nbsp;and defining production system concepts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>WP3: Performance, Cost &amp; Production Benchmarking</strong> &mdash; Quantifying material usage, recyclability, cycle times, cost per unit&nbsp;and carbon impact to guide industrial decision-making.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By actively involving engineers and decision-makers from participating companies, AZL&rsquo;s JPPs combine technical depth with strategic relevance. Participants not only gain access to engineering results and benchmarking data, but also develop in-house expertise &mdash; enabling them to communicate more effectively with customers, suppliers&nbsp;and investors in the hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) markets.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Steeped in innovative thinking</h3>\n\n<p>Previous AZL JPPs and R&amp;D programs have addressed hydrogen and CNG vessel design, filament and towpreg winding, and thermoplastic processing technologies. Within RWTH Aachen University&rsquo;s ecosystem, AZL combines design, simulation, production and testing infrastructure &mdash; covering the full range of technologies for component development, prototyping and developing production systems.</p>\n\n<p>This expertise is further amplified through the AZL Partnership Workgroup &ldquo;Composite Pipes &amp; Vessels,&rdquo;&nbsp;a dedicated platform for continuous collaboration, knowledge exchange&nbsp;and networking across the global composites industry. This new project on TPC pressure vessels builds on this&nbsp;foundation, offering participants both short-term insights and long-term strategic connections.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;AZL&rsquo;s JPPs create trusted spaces for knowledge exchange,&rdquo; adds Philipp Fr&ouml;hlig, head of industrial services at AZL Aachen GmbH. &ldquo;Our goal is to enable every participant to make well-founded technical and business decisions for their own product roadmap. Companies, independent of newcomers or established players benefit from collective benchmarking, faster learning by first-hand information and a shared understanding of what drives efficiency and competitiveness in TPC&nbsp;pressure vessel technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The next report meeting on&nbsp;Nov. 5, 2025, will provide an update on concept benchmarking and early design results for &ldquo;Thermoplastic Pressure Vessels &ndash; Benchmarking of Design-for-Manufacturing Strategies to Optimize Material Efficiency and Cost.&rdquo; Companies&nbsp;interested in hydrogen and CNG storage technologies are invited to join the consortium, gain access to the project findings&nbsp;and collaborate directly. In addition to this JPP, AZL offers individual R&amp;D support, benchmarking studies,and strategic guidance for companies developing lightweight composite pressure vessels and related components.</p>\n\n<p><em>Interested parties should reach out to Philipp Fr&ouml;hlig, head of industrial services (email:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philipp.froehlig@azl-aachen-gmbh.de/\" target=\"_blank\">philipp.froehlig@azl-aachen-gmbh.de</a>; phone:&nbsp;+49 241 475 735 14)</em></p>"

The first orbital demonstration of the joint material is planned for 2026, when a satellite will carry test panels into orbit for 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>The partnership joins FibreCoat&rsquo;s expertise in aluminum fiber&nbsp;coatings with Lofith&rsquo;s thermoplastic tape and composites manufacturing capabilities. Together, the companies will integrate FibreCoat&rsquo;s coated fibers into Lofith&rsquo;s recyclable, high-performance composites to produce lightweight structural materials designed to meet the extreme demands of space.</p>\n\n<p>During the orbital demonstration, detectors attached to the test panels will track dangerous ionizing radiation with and without shielding, temperature changes&nbsp;and other environmental effects. These results will be key to seeing if the materials are &ldquo;space-ready&rdquo;&nbsp;and meet&nbsp;the need of space companies for resilient, lightweight, cost-efficient materials. The test is expected to take place between the Q1 and Q2&nbsp;2026.</p>\n\n<p>Lofith Composites, launched in 2024, has developed an&nbsp;impregnation process that delivers up to 50%&nbsp;weight reduction and 30%&nbsp;higher strength compared to aluminum, as well as full recyclability. The process also consumes less water than conventional methods.</p>\n\n<p>FibreCoat &mdash; which recently secured &euro;500,000 in funding after winning the Industry category in the DLR INNOspace Masters&rsquo; DLR Challenge, as well as being named the overall winner of INNOspace in Pioneering Technology&nbsp;&mdash; has developed&nbsp;novel way to coat metals and plastics onto fibers, thus combining the properties of the fibers and the coating material, during the fiber&nbsp;spinning process. Its products are reported to offer strength and conductivity at a fraction of the weight and cost of competitor products; its latest Bismuth-based coating brings added functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our goal has always been to deliver the next generation of TPC: recyclable, strong&nbsp;and able to remain robust even in harsh environments,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Amador Garc&iacute;a Sancho, CEO of Lofith Composites. &ldquo;Partnering with FibreCoat enables us to combine our expertise and qualify a material that can be used for satellite panels and a wide range of other applications.&rdquo;</p>"
