Source |&nbsp;Alliance for European Flax Linen &amp; Hemp</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allianceflaxlinenhemp.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Alliance for European Flax-Linen &amp; Hemp</a>&nbsp;(Paris, France) highlights a growing wave of&nbsp;innovative architectural and civil engineering applications featuring flax and hemp fibers. As the global construction industry turns toward sustainable solutions, the organization is seeing flax and hemp emerging as high-performance, low-impact alternatives for a new generation of bio-based architecture.</p>\n\n<p>For instance,&nbsp;flax is stepping beyond interior and insulation use to form key structural elements in buildings. At the forefront of this transformation is the University of Stuttgart&rsquo;s (Germany) ITECH Research Pavilion 2024 program in Germany. Two lightweight structures have been created using filament-wound flax fibers, demonstrating the material&rsquo;s strength and design flexibility.</p>\n\n<p>The main pavilion, a semi-permanent structure, features 20 flax fiber roof beams, crafted from Terre de Lin&rsquo;s (Saint-Pierre-le-Viger, France) 100 Tex rovings and industrially processed by HA-CO Carbon GmbH&nbsp;(Wallerstein, Germany). A second, smaller pavilion incorporates co-wound wood and Safilin&rsquo;s&nbsp;(Sailly-sur-la-Lys, France) 200 Tex flax fibers in its columns and roof structure. Both projects highlight coreless robotic winding technologies and deliver striking examples of sustainable construction methods.</p>\n\n<p>Flax is also proving its value in cladding and fa&ccedil;ade systems. French manufacturer Temca (Xertigny, France) recently <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/natural-fibers-village-hosts-natural-fiber-innovations-industry-updates\" target=\"_blank\">completed 880 lightweight shading panels</a> using Bcomp&rsquo;s&nbsp;(Fribourg, Switzerland) ampliTex&nbsp;flax fiber material for the Cit&eacute; Scolaire Internationale Jacques Chirac business school in Marseille. Designed by architects Rudy Ricciotti and Roland Carta for Bouygues B&acirc;timent Sud-Est, the system uses RTM-molded ampliTex&nbsp;combined with UV-resistant gelcoat and fire-rated resin, providing a nature-inspired, energy-efficient solution with reduced weight and hardware requirements compared to traditional materials.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Dutch composite innovator NPSP&nbsp;(Delft) continues its work integrating bio-based materials in public infrastructure. In collaboration with Alliance member Procotex &nbsp;(Plouay, France) and material partner Nabasco, NPSP has delivered fa&ccedil;ades across Europe, including the vibrant green cladding of Amsterdam&rsquo;s NEMO Science Museum, designed by Renzo Piano. Nabasco&nbsp;Natural panels offer both design freedom and high fire safety standards, paving the way for bio-based fa&ccedil;ades in modern urban design.</p>\n\n<p>Recyclable molded composites company Demgy (Saint-Aubin-sur-Gaillon, France) has partnered with green roof experts Plantika&nbsp;(Vienna, Austria) to introduce Flaxcomp&nbsp;sandwich base panels for rooftop garden modules. Replacing aluminum with perforated flax composites, the solution enhances water drainage and aeration while reducing environmental impact. If successful, the trial may lead to full flax composite construction in future urban greening projects, marking a critical advance toward circular building solutions.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;These projects reflect the growing ambition of our industry to deliver carbon-smart, beautiful&nbsp;and high-performing structures using natural European fibers,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Bruno Pech, innovation project manager.</p>\n\n<p>The Alliance for European Flax Linen &amp;&nbsp;Hemp continues to support its members and partners in advancing bio-based innovation across architecture and civil engineering.</p>"

Developed in response to changing market dynamics, particularly in the 110- to 124-foot range, this project features a novel hull platform designed for long-range efficiency and the capability for speed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve experienced increasing demand for a fully custom option in the 110- to 124-foot size range,&rdquo; emphasizes&nbsp;Delta vice president Michelle Jones. &ldquo;As most of the yachts in this size are production builds, we were thrilled to work with experienced owners on their vision for a Pacific Northwest-focused family yacht, which they could operate with minimal crew and cruise the coastlines of the San Juan Islands, British Columbia and Alaska.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Delta 110 is a fully resin-infused structure built with vinyl ester resin, E-glass reinforcement&nbsp;and a thermoformed foam core. Vacuum infusion is used throughout every structural component, ensuring precise resin control and consistent laminate quality. The design relies primarily on E-glass to optimize the cost-to-performance ratio, while carbon fiber is strategically placed in high-load areas to deliver additional stiffness without adding unnecessary weight. The thermoformed foam core further enhances performance by minimizing resin uptake and reducing overall laminate weight. Delta&rsquo;s approach highlights an integration of materials and process that results in a high-performance, efficiently engineered yacht structure.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-deltamarine-delta110.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Delta 110 on the water.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-deltamarine-delta110.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Within a 24-foot beam, the yacht&rsquo;s arrangement is optimized for owner operation and family adventures with a spacious interior. It&nbsp;accommodates eight guests and two crew.&nbsp;Walk-around side decks with control stations further lend to the ease of operation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to the company, the yacht&rsquo;s new&nbsp;double chine semi-displacement hull form is a significant build in that it is the first new hull design for Delta solely tested through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. It is also Delta&rsquo;s first project that will meet full IMO III and EPA Tier 4 recognition, which facilitated the installation of the newest approved gas exhaust systems on the main engines.</p>\n\n<p>While the new hull form is designed for modest efficient cruising speeds of 12-14 knots &mdash; affording a longer range &mdash; the yacht is also capable of cruising much faster when necessary. The hull shape, coupled with twin MTU 4000s at 2,600 horsepower&nbsp;each, allows the yacht to achieve a top-end speed of 27 knots.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Creating a new hull platform that accommodates custom builds in the 110- to 124-foot size range was a unique proposition for us,&rdquo; states Jones. &ldquo;But we are thrilled with this design and for the opportunity to showcase our capabilities in advanced composites construction with a full custom, full luxury, family-oriented Pacific Northwest yacht with the capability for speed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The state-of-the-art 110-footer is among six custom yacht builds in varying stages of construction at the Delta shipyard.&nbsp;</p>"

Source (All Images) | CEAD B.V.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/cead-bv\" target=\"_blank\">CEAD&nbsp;B.V.</a> (Delft, Netherlands) has launched the Maritime Application Center (MAC), an initiative focused on accelerating the adoption of automated, sustainable production in the maritime sector. The MAC is positioned as a innovation hub where advanced manufacturing, material development&nbsp;and application engineering converge to tackle the complexity of boatbuilding and related maritime components.</p>\n\n<p>The MAC is a 2,300-square-meter space right&nbsp;around the corner of CEAD&rsquo;s headquarters&nbsp;where boats are to be developed and produced through a highly automated, digitally driven manufacturing process. MAC&rsquo;s launch introduces the company&rsquo;s two-fold vision for marine.&nbsp;First, to provide production capacity supporting shipbuilders and maritime manufacturers who are not yet ready to adopt large-scale 3D printing in-house, but are eager to reap the benefits of a highly automated production process. Second, to accelerate application development and therefore adoption of large-scale 3D printing technology in the maritime industry by working closely with industry partners and existing CEAD customers &mdash;&nbsp;sharing knowledge, co-developing solutions and pushing the boundaries of what&rsquo;s possible together.</p>\n\n<p>The MAC aims to demonstrate what the boat factory of the future looks like: a high-output, compact, automated facility where just two to three operators could produce more than&nbsp;100&nbsp;boats per year, depending on the specific factory configuration. At the MAC, CEAD is currently scaling production capacity to manufacture at least 100 boats per year, to supply the market and to actively demonstrate technical feasibility, efficiency and profitability of this factory model.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Overcoming traditional shipbuilding complexities</h3>\n\n<p>Shipbuilding today requires the combined efforts of an entire shipyard ecosystem, relying heavily on skilled labor, large-scale infrastructure and complicated, interconnected value streams. Many shipyards have spent decades optimizing for cost and specialization, creating highly segmented workflows and centralized resources. However, recent growth in demand is straining shipyards already facing surge in employee retirements, aging infrastructure and day-to-day operational inefficiencies, making it difficult to scale or adapt quickly to market demands. There is also an increasing demand to lower the maritime industry&rsquo;s impact on greenhouse gas emissions, as targets set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires organizations to transition toward&nbsp;more sustainable manufacturing approaches.</p>\n\n<p>CEAD believes that the current conditions within the maritime sector make it particularly well-suited for large-scale 3D printing technology, which addresses many of the bottlenecks the industry currently faces. For example, large-scale 3D printing technology enables the production of boat hulls directly from a digital file, eliminating time-consuming, waste-generating steps and reduces&nbsp;reliance on skilled manual labor. In doing so, it helps lower costs, shorten lead times and enables manufacturers to quickly adapt to changing market demands in both design and production capacity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>CEAD has developed a dedicated system, based on its extrusion technology, specifically designed to 3D print boat hulls in an automated manner. With this dedicated machine, the company says it has&nbsp;created a production technology that enables boatbuilding in a manner &ldquo;not feasible with standard robotic 3D printers.&rdquo; These machines form the foundation of a production facility with the flexibility to scale output as demand grows. Unlike traditional shipyards, this boat factory also operates without the need of heavy infrastructure, zoning or labor demands, making it viable in light industrial or even urban environments like the city of Delft.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>CEAD&rsquo;s history in composites 3D printing</h3>\n\n<p>Since its start in 2014, CEAD has placed R&amp;D, as well as customer success, at the core of its mission. The company is known for&nbsp;composite large-format 3D printing technologies that enable the automated production of large, complex composite parts. It&rsquo;s commitment to R&amp;D is evident in the portfolio that CEAD has developed, including robotic-&nbsp;and gantry-based solutions, a range of pellet extruders and additional functionalities such as ATLAM, scan-2-mill, datalogging&nbsp;and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The MAC is a direct result of CEAD&rsquo;s vision to go beyond delivering a machine, but to offer complete, integrated systems that provide an end-to-end solution for its customers. The MAC embodies this approach, where broad-based research is aimed at enabling the successful and accelerated adoption of large-scale 3D printing within the maritime industry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Innovation through partnerships</h3>\n\n<p>Recognizing the complexity of 3D printing entire boats, the MAC is built on a collaborative model. CEAD works closely with industry partners and provides a platform to learn and grow. Together, partners can explore everything from 3D printing design for boat hulls, material development for marine environments to process optimization and software innovations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The MAC is <a href=\"https://ceadgroup.com/contact/?utm_source=Referral&amp;utm_medium=MAC+Article-1&amp;utm_campaign=Maritime\" target=\"_blank\">open to collaborations</a> to shape the future of maritime manufacturing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We bring deep expertise in large-scale 3D printing technology, but true innovation happens when we combine that with the knowledge our industry partners have: whether it&rsquo;s about boat design, regulatory requirements&nbsp;or real-world performance,&rdquo; emphasizes&nbsp;Charl&eacute;ne van Wingerden, chief business development officer at CEAD.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that exchange of expertise that makes collaboration so powerful.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h3>Application focus: 3D printing industrial boat hulls</h3>\n\n<p>At the heart of the MAC&rsquo;s activities is a clear focus: developing and refining the process of 3D printing hulls for the professional maritime sector. It is currently&nbsp;targeting boats up to 12 meters in length, intended for industrial or defense applications, such as workboats, for example (patrol boats, fishing boats, supply boats, etc.)&nbsp;and unmanned surface vessels (USVs). The team is engaged in hands-on experimentation, exploring every aspect of the application.</p>\n\n<p>The company recently launched CEAD HDPro, a new material engineered to outperform conventional HDPE in heavy-duty maritime applications. These efforts led to the successful production of its first&nbsp;full-scale fishing boat using CEAD HDPro, completed in just 88 hours of printing time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-cead-mac-fuel-tank-print.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-cead-mac-fuel-tank-print.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Fuel tank print.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an exciting learning process. We&rsquo;re learning by doing: testing, tweaking and printing in real-time. We have to figure out new things, but that&rsquo;s exactly how real innovation happens,&rdquo; says Maarten Logtenberg, CTO at CEAD. &ldquo;The MAC is intended as a place to educate, while continuing to learn and evolve ourselves.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h3>Targeting a future of local, automated&nbsp;and green manufacturing</h3>\n\n<p>In order to reach the targets set by the IMO to reduce carbon emissions in the maritime industry, collaboration and innovation are essential, CEAD says. Large-scale 3D printing technology can empower&nbsp;shipbuilders and operators to produce vessels and components where they&rsquo;re needed and when they&rsquo;re needed. Additionally, the MAC&rsquo;s setup can be readily replicated at strategic locations around the world,&nbsp;closer to the point of use in nontraditional, compact environments.</p>\n\n<p>The MAC serves as a blueprint for an approach CEAD calls a &ldquo;CEAD-powered microfactory&rdquo;&nbsp;These high-output, compact, automated production facilities are build around CEAD&rsquo;s technology where the machines are tailored to specific applications. Thanks to the modularity of the&nbsp;systems, this microfactory model is not limited to one sector, but applicable across industries. While the MAC is specifically designed for the maritime industry, other microfactories have already been realized, such as the recently launched <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/haddy-opens-lfam-microfactory-in-florida-for-localized-agile-composite-parts-production\" target=\"_blank\">Haddy facility in Florida</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>The MAC, though already operational, will officially open its doors on June 20, 2025. CEAD invites&nbsp;maritime professionals, shipbuilders, designers&nbsp;and OEMs to attend&nbsp;the launch or learn&nbsp;more about the initiative. Interested parties can request an invitation by emailing <a href=\"mailto:mac@ceadgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">mac@ceadgroup.com</a> directly.</p>\n</div>"

This process replaces raw materials such as sand and clay, reducing CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions and conserving natural resources. In addition, researchers in China have developed methods to integrate processed blade materials into asphalt, enhancing road durability and reducing waste. Due to the large amounts of fines and dust in processed wind blades, caution for repurposing methods is advised to minimize possible health risk.</p>\n\n<p>Also discussed was fiberglass and concrete roofing concept developer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stbungalowllc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ST Bungalow</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;(Garrison, N.Y., U.S.) patented design for a <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/us-grant-is-awarded-for-patented-sip-composites-formwork-system\" target=\"_blank\">stay-in-place&nbsp;(SIP) formwork system</a> currently being 3D printed and tested at the University of Maine&rsquo;s Advanced Structures and Composites Center under grant money awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This geometry, with a vaulted shape&nbsp;form, can reinforce concrete flatwork, reducing the amount&nbsp;of concrete and steel reinforcement required. These permanent structures &mdash; ranging from 4-8 meters in size&nbsp;&mdash; comprise a minimum of 30% recycled fiber-reinforced polymers, presenting an&nbsp;opportunity for consumption of large&nbsp;amounts of processed wind blades.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these examples, Isodan says&nbsp;assessments are being explored for processed blade fibers use in manufacturing composite building materials, components for vehicles and sports equipment, offering alternative lightweight and durable material alternatives.

Specializing in&nbsp;hydrokinetic machines, the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;patented undulating membrane draws inspiration from the movements of fish tails. This biomimetic design captures kinetic energy from water currents, providing a sustainable method for generating electricity that is efficient and nondisruptive to aquatic ecosystems.</p>\n\n<p>The undulating membrane traces its origins to research in the medical field by Jean-Baptiste Drevet in 1996. He leveraged a polymer membrane that mimicked the undulating movement of marine animals to propel fluids, functioning as a pump that creates flow similar to the human heart. This technology has proven effective in medical devices and is adaptable for use in renewable energy generation. The vortices created by turbulent flow in water can be captured by a flexible membrane and the undulating motion used to drive an electrical generator</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our membrane used to be made up of a semi-rigid structure covered in a rubber layer,&rdquo; explains&nbsp;Xavier Peroutka, CEO at EEL. &ldquo;The rubber acted as a sail, capturing the pressure from the water&rsquo;s current and transmitting it to the membrane&rsquo;s skeleton. As the membrane deformed, strain energy was generated and transformed into electricity through electromagnetic converters positioned on the membrane.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Coils of wire placed within the structure moved relative to magnets embedded in the system during deformation,&rdquo; continues Peroutka.&nbsp;&ldquo;This movement induces an electrical current through electromagnetic induction, converting the membrane&rsquo;s mechanical energy into electrical energy.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>However, as EEL embarks on bringing hydrokinetic energy production to market, it faces significant challenges. The underwater environment is particularly demanding, necessitating materials that can withstand extreme stress and pressure.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hydrokinetic generation exerts up to 30 times more mechanical stress on equipment than wind energy production,&rdquo; notes&nbsp;Peroutka. &ldquo;Despite the challenges, it&rsquo;s worth persevering.&nbsp;While&nbsp;a wave power generator relies on intermittent wave action and solar and wind depend on favorable weather conditions, hydrokinetic generators can produce energy constantly throughout their life by leveraging the water currents in rivers or tidal flow. The predictability of hydrokinetic energy generation is needed by communities across the globe.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h3>Seeking material expertise</h3>\n\n<p>Initially, EEL reinforced its membrane with fiberglass, but this original design revealed a critical flaw: delamination. Under the harsh cyclic loading of the underwater conditions, the membrane underwent large deformations, inducing high strains in the structure. The strain caused the layers of the membrane to separate, enabling water to infiltrate and compromise its functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the serious implications of this issue &mdash; where a failure of the membrane during operation could jeopardize the entire hydrokinetic system &mdash; EEL sought the expertise of materials specialist Exel Composites&nbsp;to develop a solution capable of withstanding the continuous mechanical stress required for effective operation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-l m-r-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>EEL Hydrokinetic generators</h3>\n\n<p><strong>30-kilowatt version</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Membrane size : 5 &times; 7 meters</li>\n\t<li>Rated Power: 30 kilowatts&nbsp;@ 2.8 meters/second</li>\n\t<li>Annual production: 105-150 megawatt-hours</li>\n\t<li>Min. water depth: 4.5 meters</li>\n\t<li>Water velocity: 1.2-3.0 meters/second</li>\n\t<li>Current seam: 3.5 meters</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>300-kilowatt version</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Membrane Size: 10 &times;&nbsp;15 meters</li>\n\t<li>Rated power: 300 kilowatts at&nbsp;3.2 meters/second</li>\n\t<li>Annual production: 0.8-1.2 gigawatt-hours</li>\n\t<li>Min. water depth: 10 meters</li>\n\t<li>Water velocity: 1.5-3.5 meters/second</li>\n\t<li>Current seam: 6 meters</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>For Exel, specializing in&nbsp;pultruded and pull-wound composite materials, this challenge illustrated the complexity of creating a solution that was both durable, while balancing flexibility and resilience. The quest for a material that could endure the rigors of underwater energy generation became the focal point of the collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, the solution didn&rsquo;t require inventing something new. Rather, it resided in a proven material already designed to withstand the rigors of renewable energy production. One that can resist bending without breaking under the demands of the environment.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The key to our successful collaboration was recognizing that our carbon fiber flats, originally designed for wind turbine blades, could be repurposed for EEL&rsquo;s hydrokinetic membranes,&rdquo; explains&nbsp;Neil Dykes, R&amp;D&nbsp;manager at Exel Composites. &ldquo;These flats provide the stiffness and strength required to withstand harsh wind conditions, making them ideal for this application.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-eelenergy-hydrokinetic-system-above.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Hydrokinetic system construction.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-eelenergy-hydrokinetic-system-above.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Exel used multiple layers of discrete carbon flat profiles, the same as those developed for wind turbine applications. These carbon fiber flats are stacked to create beams which were strategically integrated into the membrane. Three bars were placed across it at 50%, 80%&nbsp;and 100% of its length. This arrangement prevents bulging and limits overall deformation, ensuring the membrane maintains structural integrity and operates optimally.</p>\n\n<p>Excessive deformation, particularly uneven bulging outside the intended undulatory motion, can significantly reduce energy capture efficiency. When the membrane deforms, it disrupts the smooth oscillating flow of water over its surface, diminishing the area available for energy conversion and leading to suboptimal mechanical energy transfer to the electromagnetic converters.</p>\n\n<h3>How did carbon flats improve the design?</h3>\n\n<p>The integration of these carbon fiber flats was crucial for enhancing the membrane&rsquo;s mechanical performance. By increasing stiffness and resistance to deformation, they help preserve the membrane&rsquo;s shape during operation, ensuring effective energy capture while adhering to biomimetic design principles.</p>\n\n<p>The high strength and stiffness provided by the carbon fiber flats supplied by Exel Composites resolved the delamination issues previously encountered with glass fiber-reinforced composites (GFRP), which compromised the membrane&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-l m-r-2 m-t-1\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Inspired by fish tails, EEL Energy&rsquo;s membrane flexes continuously with the current &mdash; more than 6,000 times a day &mdash; making fatigue resistance a critical hurdle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<p>Notably, the&nbsp;mechanical properties of Exel&rsquo;s&nbsp;carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites were essential to the membrane&rsquo;s success. With an E-modulus of approximately 120 GPa, CFRP exhibits higher stiffness than traditional GFRP, which is only a third of CFRP&nbsp;stiffness. This high stiffness ensures the membrane retains its shape under operational stress, preventing excessive deformation and energy loss.</p>\n\n<p>CFRP&rsquo;s tensile strength of 2,500 MPa, compared to GFRP&rsquo;s&nbsp;1,000 MPa also enables the former&nbsp;to withstand greater forces without failure. Additionally, CFRP&rsquo;s compressive strength, at 1,500 MPa, is much greater than the 600 MPa typical of GFRP. This increased strength, combined with CFRP&rsquo;s optimal fatigue resistance, ensures the membrane can handle the cyclic loading conditions experienced during operation, supporting up to 6,000 full reversal cycles per day. This durability is key for maintaining high efficiency in energy capture over the long term.</p>\n\n<h3>The future of EEL hydrokinetics</h3>\n\n<p>With these challenges resolved, EEL is now shifting its focus to the development of the main hydrokinetic generator, a crucial step toward commercialization after nearly a decade of membrane refinement. This transition also opens new opportunities for Exel Composites&rsquo;&nbsp;carbon flats, which could be pivotal in meeting future performance demands.</p>\n\n<p>EEL&rsquo;s current project includes developing a medium-sized hydrokinetic generator designed to generate 50 kilowatts&nbsp;per hour. This generator targets isolated communities across the Americas, where many areas face significant energy access challenges due to geographic isolation from the main grid. The vast expanse of this region leaves numerous rural populations disconnected from centralized power sources. EEL aims to support local governments by providing consistent, reliable hydrokinetic energy tailored to the communities&rsquo; needs, eliminating reliance on expensive and polluting hydrocarbon generators.</p>\n\n<p>In parallel, EEL is developing a larger hydrokinetic generator aimed at energy producers such as EDF and Octopus, targeting an output of 1 megawatt&nbsp;per hour. These installations are envisioned as hydrokinetic farms located in rivers and coastal areas. A single hydrokinetic generator could power 796 North American homes, and generator farms with multiple generators could enhance regional energy capacity.</p>\n\n<p>EEL says its&nbsp;hydrokinetic technology promises predictable, sustainable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered generators prevalent in remote areas. As the company prepares for commercialization, ongoing discussions with electricity providers and local governments demonstrate its commitment to supporting communities in the shift toward&nbsp;cleaner energy sources.</p>"
