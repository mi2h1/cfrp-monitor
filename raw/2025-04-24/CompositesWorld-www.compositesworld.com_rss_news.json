Source | Wickert</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Since 2024, what <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/wickert-hydraulic-presses-usa\" target=\"_blank\">Wickert</a> (Landau, Germany) contends is the world&rsquo;s fastest heating/cooling&nbsp;press has been in operation at the Institute of Lightweight Structures (IST), part of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en\" target=\"_blank\">Chemnitz University of Technology</a>&nbsp;(Germany). With its high tempering speeds, the Wickert&nbsp;WKP 3000 S has been enabling the university scientists to process high-performance&nbsp;thermoplastics such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) in record time.</p>\n\n<p>The team, led by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Nendel, is researching how structural components and hybrid components made of plastics, like fiber-reinforced composites,&nbsp;and metal can be manufactured using near-series production processes. Their focus is on structural&nbsp;components for aerospace, automotive&nbsp;and electromobility. Typical applications include tanks for hydrogen systems, battery carriers for electric vehicles, crash-relevant car parts for front- and rear-ends, and drainage and manhole systems for the construction industry.</p>\n\n<p>Another field of research concerns thermoplastic carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRTP)&nbsp;profiles for aircraft components. Chemnitz scientists&nbsp;are investigating how these high-performance materials can be processed in cost-effective, large-scale production. The focus here is on materials that can replace standard polymers such as PP and PE as well as engineering plastics such as PA, PC, POM and PET when they reach their performance limits. Wickert&rsquo;s hydraulic press is helping them to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;WKP 3000 S achieves peak temperatures of up to 450&deg; C across the entire 600 &times;&nbsp;600-millimeter pressing area. It currently delivers heating rates of 55 Kelvin/minute and cooling rates of up to 100 Kelvin/minute. The maximum deviation over the entire surface is less than 5&deg;C.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the press&nbsp;reaches its full press force of 3,000 kilonewtons&nbsp;in under one second. The plane parallelism, less than 0.1 millimeter, and a maximum lateral offset of 0.02 millimeter enable processing with a high&nbsp;level of precision.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Wickert&nbsp;press &mdash; in particular, its&nbsp;extreme speeds of temperature control &mdash; have added value in [our] research,&rdquo; Nendel says. &ldquo;This allows us to design test series much more effectively and create many more samples in the shortest possible time.&rdquo; A production cycle that takes a few minutes on the Wickert press would take over an hour on a normal press, for example.</p>"

Archer&rsquo;s goal is to enable passengers to travel from Manhattan to nearby airports in just 5-15 minutes using <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-rolls-out-first-midnight-aircraft-prepares-for-flight-testing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Midnight</em></a>, the company&rsquo;s electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) platform, in order to dramatically reduce&nbsp;travel times compared to traditional ground transportation and help&nbsp;avoid the city&rsquo;s notorious traffic.</p>\n\n<p><em>Midnight</em>, featuring a composites-intensive <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-unveils-production-aircraft-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">design</a>,&nbsp;can carry up to four passengers while producing less noise and emissions than a traditional helicopter. <em>Midnight</em> is built with redundant systems across the aircraft &mdash;including 12 total engines and propellers &mdash; enabling Archer to target similar levels of safety as commercial airliners. Archer is building <em>Midnight</em> at manufacturing facilities in San Jose, California,&nbsp;and Covington, Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Archer will look to use existing aviation properties around the region, with a goal of establishing vertiports associated with airports and helipads in the area.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0425-cw-news-archer-midnight-render-nyc1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Midnight aircraft render over NYC.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0425-cw-news-archer-midnight-render-nyc1.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The company continues work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to earn earn the aircraft&rsquo;s type certification. Once received, Archer&nbsp;and its operating partners plan to safely and seamlessly integrate <em>Midnight</em> into service, beginning with major airports like those in the NYC area. Archer received its FAA Part 135 Air Carrier and Operator certificate <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-announces-part-135-certification-to-begin-operating-commercial-aircraft\" target=\"_blank\">in June 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Under this concept of operations, passengers would book Archer flights as a complement to traditional airline travel, reducing door-to-door travel times. United previously placed an order for a fleet of Archer&rsquo;s <em>Midnight</em> aircraft and has remained a long-time investor in the company.</p>\n\n<p>Archer is also working closely with existing infrastructure partners, including Atlantic Aviation, Signature Aviation and Skyports/GroupeADP, as well as new partners Modern Aviation and Air Pegasus, to develop and electrify aviation assets in this proposed network.

In addition, this technology can be used to enhance a composite material&rsquo;s properties&nbsp;in through-the-thickness direction and to improve the performance of bonded joints in composite assemblies, as well as improving the repair and healing of the damaged composite parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-WSU-nanotechnology-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Dr. Davood Askari.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-WSU-nanotechnology-3.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Dr. Davood Askari.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Traditional composite materials often struggle with delamination and poor bonding between layers,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Askari. &ldquo;Our technology enhances the interlocking between components at the nanoscale, which in turn strengthens the material at the structural level. This means stronger and tougher airplane parts and car components, and more resilient protective gears.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike straight carbon nanotubes, HCNTs have a coiled structure that enable mechanical&nbsp;interlocking within resin matrices and in between the traditional microfiber reinforcements used in composites. Through a series of chemical functionalization techniques &mdash; using controlled acid treatments and proprietary processing &mdash; Askari&rsquo;s team was able to disperse these nanotubes more effectively into epoxy resins and achieve improved tensile strength, fracture toughness, modulus, strain-to-failure and hardness, even at ultra-low weight percentages.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our nanocomposite technology helps create lightweight materials with improved mechanical, electrical and thermal properties,&rdquo; Askari says. &ldquo;And because our processes are compatible with existing manufacturing techniques, they can be scaled up and adopted across industries.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The novel&nbsp;materials are currently being evaluated in collaboration with industry partners for use in aerospace structures and other high-performance applications. The innovation is protected by two patents related to the functionalization of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uspto.report/patent/app/20190382269\" target=\"_blank\">helical nanotubes</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190308905A1/en\" target=\"_blank\">creation of interlocking nanocomposite structures</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, this is about reliability,&rdquo; Askari adds. &ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re designing spacecraft, submarines or medical devices, materials that are stronger and lighter can make a tremendous difference in safety, efficiency and cost.&rdquo;</p>"

Source | Venus Aerospace</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.venusaero.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Venus Aerospace</a>&nbsp;(Houston, Texas, U.S.), an aerospace startup building advanced engine systems for hypersonic flight, has successfully completed a technological advancement supported by a NASA&nbsp;Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award&nbsp;&mdash; new nozzle designs &mdash; that, having exceeded expectations, will outfit Venus&rsquo; hypersonic&nbsp;rocket engine system during an upcoming flight demonstration later in summer 2025.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already proven our engine outperforms traditional systems on both<br />\nefficiency and size,&rdquo; says&nbsp;CEO Sassie Duggleby. &ldquo;The technology we developed<br />\nwith NASA&rsquo;s support will now be part of our integrated engine platform &mdash;bringing us one step closer to proving that efficient, compact and affordable hypersonic flight can be scaled.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The engine at the center of Venus&rsquo;s flight platform is a rotating detonation<br />\nrocket engine (RDRE), a system that the company says has been long considered promising but never proven at scale, at least until now. Unlike conventional rocket engines, the Venus RDRE operates through supersonic shockwaves &mdash; called detonations &mdash;that generate more power with less fuel.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is just the beginning of what can be achieved with Venus propulsion<br />\ntechnology,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Andrew Duggleby, Venus Aerospace CTO. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built a<br />\ncompact, high-performance system that unlocks speed, range&nbsp;and agility across aerospace, defense and many other applications. And we&rsquo;re confident in its readiness for flight.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Composites may be the future for Venus Aerospace</h3>\n\n<p>Venus Aerospace&nbsp;says there are &ldquo;many innovations on the horizon,&rdquo;&nbsp;but not just for its hypersonic RDRE&nbsp;engine system. While the company&rsquo;s primary&nbsp;focus is on advancing propulsion systems, Venus Aerospace&rsquo;s Andrew Duggleby&nbsp;says the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;involvement extends to various elements of launch vehicle components. This includes the use of&nbsp;carbon fiber composite&nbsp;honeycomb for vehicle fins and the use of composites for other structural elements.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our team is always seeking to integrate design solutions that enhance performance and efficiency, and composites are becoming an increasingly important part of the Venus story,&rdquo; Duggleby says. &ldquo;While our current use [the vehicle fins] is targeted and pragmatic, it reflects a broader approach: using the right material for the right job. Leveraging off-the-shelf composite solutions helps us move fast, stay cost-effective and focus our innovation on what matters most. We're excited about how composites will continue to expand across future Venus Aerospace designs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He notes that Venus is&nbsp;continually accessing advanced materials, including ceramic matrix composites (CMC), for all engine components, finding that their properties, like thermal resilience and durability, are&nbsp;crucial for the performance standards the company&nbsp;places on its engines. &ldquo;The details regarding our precise CMC applications are confidential, but we continue to evaluate their use in our designs,&rdquo; Duggleby concludes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>This summer&rsquo;s flight will mark a significant milestone in demonstrating Venus&rsquo; engine at scale,&nbsp;building&nbsp;on a series of&nbsp;advances at Venus Aerospace. In fall 2024,the company unveiled a high-speed engine system that enables takeoff, acceleration and hypersonic cruise &mdash; all powered by a single engine architecture.</p>\n\n<p>While most high-speed systems require multiple engines to operate at different speeds, Venus says its&nbsp;approach eliminates the cost, weight&nbsp;and complexity of traditional propulsion technology. The system delivers rocket-like takeoff power and jet-like cruise efficiency, and it enables a vehicle to accelerate from runway to Mach 5+ without changing engines.</p>\n\n<p>The Venus system supports a wide range of applications, including spacecraft landers, low-Earth orbit satellite, space cargo transfer vehicles, rocket kick-stages and hypersonic drones and missiles.</p>"

Source | Fraunhofer EMI</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Researchers from the <a href=\"https://www.emi.fraunhofer.de/en/the-institute.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fraunhofer Institute for High-Speed Dynamics, Ernst-Mach-Institut</a> (Fraunhofer EMI, Breisgau, Germany)&nbsp;report that they have developed a technology that makes it possible to reclaim continuous carbon fibers from composite materials,&nbsp;without diminishing material quality. High-power lasers are used for local degradation of the matrix of multilayered fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) at high temperatures, offering a solution with ecological&nbsp;benefits and economic potential.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: start;\">Some <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/trends-fueling-the-composites-recycling-movement\" target=\"_blank\">current FRP recycling methods</a> involve a shredding step, which shortens the fibers and leads to downcycling. Unlike these methods, Fraunhofer EMI uses a&nbsp;high-power laser for controlled reclamation of the fiber reinforcement and thermoset matrix. Researchers say this method is especially relevant for recycling wound structures, such as&nbsp;pressurized hydrogen tanks, where a continuous carbon fiber roving is wound around a plastic liner to make the tank able to withstand high internal service pressures of up to 700&nbsp;bar.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: start;\">The advantage of this recycling method lies in the ability to remove the the thermoset&nbsp;matrix surrounding carbon fibers via a local pyrolysis, while leaving the fibers themselves nearly undamaged. &ldquo;We perform the pyrolysis of the matrix and the unwinding of the fiber roving simultaneously, at a reasonable speed without damaging the carbon fibers,&rdquo;&nbsp;explains project manager Mathieu Imbert.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: start;\">A challenge to this process lies&nbsp;in defining the optimum process window &mdash; the thermoset matrix&rsquo;s thermal degradation occurs at temperatures of 300-600&deg;C, while fibers might start getting damaged at around 600&deg;C.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: start;\">&ldquo;We found a good compromise between the process efficiency and the quality of the recycled material,&rdquo; Imbert says. &ldquo;Our results show that the continuous fibers reclaimed in this way have the same performance properties as new fibers, which makes this method highly attractive.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: start;\">Because&nbsp;heat is applied locally, and the fiber roving is continuously reclaimed at the same time, there is no need for the long pyrolysis times and high process costs typically required when working with thick-walled hydrogen tanks. Furthermore, the laser-assisted reclamation process requires only about one-fifth of the amount of energy required to produce new fibers. These&nbsp;are key advantages in the current context of rising energy costs and increasing environmental requirements.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: start;\">The research, part of the DigiTain project, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, is slated to run until the end of 2025. Fraunhofer EMI researchers are currently working to make the process even more energy-efficient and to further improve the quality of the reclaimed fibers.&nbsp;</p>"
