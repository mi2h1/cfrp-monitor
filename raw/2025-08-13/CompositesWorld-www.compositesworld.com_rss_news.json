Source | Joby Aviation</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In early August 2025, <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joby Aviation</a> (Santa Cruz, Calif., U.S.) has announced recent business developments, including&nbsp;that it is preparing for final assembly of its first conforming aircraft intended for type inspection authorization (TIA) flight tests, as well as its plans to acquire&nbsp;Blade Air Mobility Inc.&rsquo;s&nbsp;(New York, N.Y., U.S.) urban air mobility (UAM) passenger business.</p>\n\n<p>TIA flight testing of a conforming aircraft is a convergence of three critical initiatives within Joby that are aligned with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards: (1) relevant test plan approvals, (2) a design that meets FAA standards&nbsp;and (3) the ability to manufacture the conforming design. Having successfully progressed all three ahead of assembly &mdash; including FAA acceptance of more than half of the company&rsquo;s test plans&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;this milestone continues to move Joby into the final stage of FAA certification and closer to commercializing its electric eVTOL aircraft.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Every component, every system&nbsp;and every test we have completed over the past 15 years has led us to this point,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Didier Papadopoulos, president of aircraft OEM.&nbsp;Successful tests have included static load testing on primary aerostructures &mdash; where engineers applied forces far exceeding expected flight loads &mdash; and testing of aircraft components and systems,&nbsp;incorporating important instrumentation and sensor calibration essential for TIA.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are now bringing it all together on the first of several aircraft that will be used for the final phase of FAA flight testing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Joby expects its pilots to start flying this aircraft in 2025, with FAA pilots following shortly thereafter to directly evaluate the aircraft&rsquo;s performance and safety. This testing is central to the certification process and forms a key part of the fifth, and final, stage of the type certification process.</p>\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/joby-expands-california-and-ohio-manufacturing-capacity-adds-new-aircraft-to-fleet\" target=\"_blank\">manufacturing expansion</a> in California and Ohio, along with its close collaboration with Toyota, will enable Joby to double its production capacity to 24 aircraft per year.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these commercialization efforts, Joby Aviation has plans to acquire all of Blade&rsquo;s passenger business, including operations in the U.S. and Europe and the Blade brand.&nbsp;Blade&rsquo;s Medical division, which was not included in the transaction and will remain a separate public company, is to partner with Joby on medical transportation.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to unlocking immediate market access and infrastructure across key urban corridors in New York City and Southern Europe, the acquisition will enable&nbsp;Joby to combine its technology with Blade&rsquo;s decade of experience delivering premium customer transportation at scale, as Joby looks ahead to carrying its first passengers <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/joby-to-launch-evtol-aircraft-service-in-the-uae\" target=\"_blank\">in Dubai</a> in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>Blade flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024 from a network of 12 urban terminals situated in some of the most important UAM markets globally. This includes dedicated lounge and terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty Airport, as well as the West Side of Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan and Wall Street. Blade passenger operations are expected to continue as normal, with the business continuing to be led by Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal as a wholly owned subsidiary of Joby.</p>\n\n<p>By using Blade&rsquo;s existing infrastructure and gradually transitioning a large loyal base of passengers from conventional helicopters to&nbsp;Joby aircraft, Joby expects to be able to accelerate its commercialization while reducing infrastructure investment requirements and customer acquisition costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As part of the transaction, Joby will also become the preferred eVTOL partner to Blade&rsquo;s organ transport business &mdash; which will remain a separate public company to be renamed Strata Critical Medical&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;wherever Joby has operations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks, subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions.</p>"

The first two vessels in this series, Buran and Ostro, were delivered in February and April 2025, respectively, following their construction at Fujian Southeast Shipbuilding. Union Maritime have two additional 18,500 DWT tankers currently under construction at Fujian Southeast Shipbuilding and two more at Wuhu Shipyard Co.&nbsp;Ltd, which will all be equipped with Norsepower Rotor Sails, with deliveries scheduled throughout 2025.</p>\n\n<p>These six vessels mark the first wave of a broader new build program&nbsp;for Union Maritime under BV class. More than 25 additional tankers are scheduled for delivery between 2026 and 2028, including a significant series at Wuhu Shipyard, with further vessels being built at other major Chinese shipyards. These vessels will either be delivered with wind propulsion systems installed or prepared for future integration, using technologies from various suppliers such as Norsepower.</p>\n\n<p>By incorporating wind propulsion systems and methanol-ready configurations, Union Maritime is aiming to improve energy efficiency and support long-term emissions reduction across its expanding fleet.</p>\n\n<p>Norsepower also secured an agreement in May 2025 to deliver six of its Rotor Sails&nbsp;for a fleet of newbuild tankers commissioned by <a href=\"https://www.gefo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GEFO Shipping Group</a> (Hamburg, Germany). These newbuild vessels, designed by Ship Design &amp; Consult GmbH (SDC), and constructed by Nantong Xiangyu Shipbuilding,&nbsp;will be delivered between 2026 and 2028 with the rotor sails installed.</p>\n\n<p>The agreement covers six tankers across two distinct designs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Four 3,850 DWT&nbsp;chemical tankers, each to be equipped with one 20 &times; 4-meter&nbsp;Rotor Sails.</li>\n\t<li>Two 7,900 DWT chemical tankers, each to be equipped with one 28 &times;4-meter Rotor Sail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All six rotor sails will feature Norsepower&rsquo;s EX-compliant design, certified for use on vessels transporting flammable cargoes and compliant with all class and safety requirements. These rotor sails will be manufactured at Norsepower&rsquo;s dedicated factory in China, and delivered to the yard fully assembled, tested and ready for installation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a landmark agreement for Norsepower, not just because it involves two new customers and six vessels &mdash; but because it signals a fundamental shift in how wind propulsion is perceived in commercial shipping,&rdquo; notes Heikki P&ouml;ntynen, CEO of Norsepower. &ldquo;We are no longer talking about one-off pilot installations; we are now securing full-fleet commitments.&rdquo;</p>"

The 6-meter, 1-ton structures, made of carbon fiber, aluminum&nbsp;and titanium for critical connections, will&nbsp;measure humidity and temperature as well as aerosols.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This weather satellite, together with its five counterparts, will significantly enhance weather forecasting accuracy and climate change monitoring,&rdquo; says Oliver Grassmann, executive VP&nbsp;satellites at Beyond Gravity. &ldquo;A key element of this mission is our radio occultation&nbsp;[RO] instrument, which provides important weather data.&rdquo;&nbsp;RO&nbsp;in space measures how radio signals from satellites bend as they pass through Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, helping understand weather, climate and atmospheric conditions. &ldquo;The instrument will more than double the number of occultations to 2,100 per day per instrument &hellip;&nbsp;and will provide RO data until 2050.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this instrument,&nbsp;Beyond Gravity provided the satellite&rsquo;s primary structure, thermal insulation and multiple&nbsp;products for the <em>Ariane 6</em> launcher. The prime contractor for the satellite is Airbus Defence and Space (Toulouse, France).</p>\n\n<p>European MetOp weather satellites have been orbiting the Earth from the North Pole to the South Pole since 2006. With this satellite, the first of six weather satellites of the latest generation, MetOp-SG, will be launched into space and will join the existing two MetOp weather satellites of the first generation already in orbit. These&nbsp;satellites will ensure the continued global observations from polar orbit. In the coming years, the other&nbsp;MetOp-SG satellites&nbsp;will be launched. With climate change driving more frequent and severe extreme weather events, precise and timely weather forecasting has never been more critical.</p>\n\n<p>In total, MetOp-SG&nbsp;consists of six satellites: three successive pairs made up of an A-type and a B-type satellite, which carry a host of different but complementary instruments. The current satellite is an A-type (MetOp-SG-A). The A-type satellites also carry Copernicus Sentinel-5 ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared to measure key air pollutants and climate-related gases. The MetOp-SG mission has been developed in a long-standing cooperation between the ESA and Eumetsat.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0825-cw-news-metop-satellite-ariane6-fairing.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0825-cw-news-metop-satellite-ariane6-fairing.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Sealing the MetOp-SG-A1 satellite within the&nbsp;<em>Ariane 6</em> fairing before its launch.

The insulation consists of several layers of very thin metal-coated plastic and was produced in Berndorf, Austria.</p>\n\n<p>The top of the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/ariane-6-heavy-lift-rocket-makes-inaugural-launch\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ariane 6</em> rocket</a>, on which MetOp-SG&nbsp;will be launched, consists of the payload fairing from Beyond Gravity made of carbon fiber composite. The fairing has a diameter of 5.4 meters. Produced at the Beyond Gravity site in Emmen, Switzerland, the two halves of the payload fairing protect the satellite from the harsh forces experienced during launch and the early flight stages.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond Gravity&rsquo;s site in Link&ouml;ping, Sweden, provided the payload adapter system for <em>Ariane 6</em> as well. The payload adapter system connects satellite and launcher during liftoff, then precisely releases the satellite into orbit once the proper altitude is reached.</p>\n\n<p>In Austria, Beyond Gravity also produced the high-temperature insulation for the rocket engines of the launcher&rsquo;s lower and upper stage as well as the engine gimbal for alignment of the rocket&rsquo;s upper stage.&nbsp;This rocket engine insulation consists of glass fabric and polymer films.</p>"

The flight tested integration of Scout&rsquo;s <em>Morning Sparrow</em>&nbsp;sensor suite aboard the composites-intensive <em>Aurora</em> platform, flying from a conventional runway at Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre in New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p>This flight also marks Scout as the first commercial operator to fly on Dawn Aerospace&rsquo;s rocket-powered, high-altitude aircraft&nbsp;under a strategic partnership in which Scout will develop a tactically responsive very-low Earth orbit (VLEO) space domain awareness capability. The combination of supersonic flight testing and runway-based operations gives Scout an accelerated&nbsp;path to proving new SDA technologies that are easier, more repeatable and more affordable.</p>\n\n<p><em>Morning Sparrow</em>&nbsp;flew to a maximum altitude of 67,000 feet, and a maximum speed of Mach 1.03. In follow-on flights, <em>Morning Sparrow</em>&rsquo;s sensor suite will be used to gather data and demonstrate the sensor&rsquo;s capability to track and image VLEO objects from below &mdash; offering a responsive platform for urgent, time-sensitive intelligence-gathering and a cost-efficient alternative to conventional satellite-based SDA.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0825-cw-news-dawn-scoutspace-flight.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Pictures of earth in very low earth orbit.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0825-cw-news-dawn-scoutspace-flight.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p><em>Aurora</em> took off from Tāwhaki National Aerospace Centre&nbsp;on July 17, 2025.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Rapidly deployable, high-performance, high-altitude platforms are notoriously few and far between,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Philip Hover-Smoot, CEO of Scout Space. <em>&ldquo;</em>Accelerating flexible access to VLEO represents a leap forward in how we think about&nbsp;taskable surveillance and space security in rapidly evolving low-orbit environments, and unlocks new options for operators looking for otherwise limited intelligence products across the increasingly important VLEO regime.<em>&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>The sensor, housed in the <em>Aurora</em>&rsquo;s payload bay, was accessible up to moments before flight showcasing the ease of integration, rapid access&nbsp;and easy hardware adjustments for space-class optics into aircraft-grade environments.
