Securing first place at Formula Bharat 2025, the team now holds seven&nbsp;National Championship titles, is ranked seventh in Formula Student and was the only Indian team to make Top 10 in 2023. <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/team-kratos-racing-welcomes-sponsorship-for-composite-formula-student-race-vehicle\" target=\"_blank\">Team Kratos participates in various competitions</a>, including Formula Student East head in Budapest, Hungary, and Formula Student Germany in Hockenheim.</p>\n\n<p>The team aims to adopt&nbsp;a single-piece, in-house manufactured carbon fiber-aluminum honeycomb monocoque chassis for its upcoming Formula Student race car. Compared to the&nbsp;earlier two-piece design joined with a double butt joint, the single-piece structure offers an optimized&nbsp;strength-to-weight ratio,&nbsp;increased torsional stiffness and improved force distribution. It also enhances structural integrity under dynamic and crash loads while contributing to better aerodynamic efficiency due to its&nbsp;uninterrupted surface geometry.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-TeamKratos-Jan25-winner-min.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"Team Kratos cheering.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-TeamKratos-Jan25-winner-min.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Formula Bharat 2025 championship.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Last year, Team Kratos built a high-performance monocoque chassis using carbon fiber prepreg/aramid and&nbsp;aluminum honeycomb for its race car. This year, the team is taking a major step by integrating hub motors, moving away the conventional central drive configuration. This decentralized drivetrain architecture has the potential to enhance vehicle dynamics and improve system efficiency, positioning the team to compete at a higher level as it prepares for international competitions.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve these goals, Team Kratos is welcoming a sponsored partner who may be willing to contribute to this hub motor project.&nbsp;In return, the team&nbsp;offers the same benefits as the year prior: Substantial exposure through car branding, team uniforms, promotional materials&nbsp;and social media. This partnership would highlight the sponsoring company&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and quality in front of a dedicated audience.&nbsp;Additionally, the&nbsp;team can provide an 80G certificate, enabling sponsors to avail themselves of CSR benefits.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As the level of competition intensifies, the need for cutting-edge innovation and advanced technologies becomes greater than ever,&rdquo; says Upendra Patil, mechanical chief technical officer for&nbsp;Team Kratos Racing Electric. &ldquo;To continue pushing boundaries &mdash; from integrating hub motors to building a<br />\none-piece monocoque &mdash; we rely not just on talent, but also on vital<br />\nmonetary support. Contributions from the composites industry fuels&nbsp;the future of mobility and keeps us racing ahead on the world stage.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Team sponsors include Tesla, Dassault Systemes, Gefran, Brose, Zeliot, Kairali, Aeron, Starcke, Gefran, Vactech, Trade Syndicate, Tata Motors, Indexnine, Altium, Vactech, Bosch, Analog Devices, ThreeBond, SVCE, AludecoR, Dassault Systems, Durga, Siemens and Sthenos Composites.</p>\n\n<p>For those interested in sponsoring, email marketing.kratosracing@gmail.com or reach out at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:operations.kratosracing@pccoepune.org\" target=\"_blank\">operations.kratosracing@pccoepune.org</a>.</p>"

Source | Pusan National University</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Estimating composite material properties can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Researchers from <a href=\"https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/Main.do\" target=\"_blank\">Pusan National University</a> (Busan, South Korea) have proposed a reduced basis homogenization method (RBHM) to enhance&nbsp;homogenization based on a finite element method (FEM). According to the research, <a href=\"https://10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2024.109801\" target=\"_blank\">published in the&nbsp;International Journal of Mechanical Sciences</a>&nbsp;in November 2024,&nbsp;RBHM&nbsp;significantly improves computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>When predicting the performance of a composite material in real-world conditions, engineers usually rely on experimental testing or numerical analysis to predict homogenized properties like thermal conductivity and elasticity, but these approaches can be time-consuming or computationally expensive.</p>\n\n<p>The numerical homogenization process approximates composite material properties at a macroscopic scale by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) at a microscopic scale. The team, led by Pusan&rsquo;s Professor&nbsp;Kyunghoon Lee, proposed RBHM&nbsp;to speed up numerical homogenization. RBHM decreases the computational cost by performing numerical homogenization on a reduced basis space and allows one to easily change fiber and matrix materials to obtain desired composite material properties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Through the use of the RBHM, we can rapidly yet accurately generate the solutions of microscale PDEs. We then use these solutions to quickly evaluate the homogenized properties of a periodic composite material as we try various combinations of fiber and matrix materials,&rdquo; explains Lee. RBHM expedites numerical homogenization, particularly for parametric analyses requiring multiple simulations, while providing prompt evaluations of macroscopic properties with minimal error.</p>\n\n<p>The RBHM&nbsp;method has also achieved computational speeds up to 1,030 times faster than the FEM for evaluating thermal properties and 670 times faster for elastic properties, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of the FEM. RBHM predictions matched not only the FEM predictions but also the experimental data, providing confidence in the method&rsquo;s reliability. For instance, RBHM produced homogenized thermal conductivity and Young&rsquo;s modulus with errors of less than 5% and less than 3%, respectively, compared with experimental results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our method also allows for easy adjustments to fiber and matrix properties, enabling engineers to swiftly explore and test new fiber and matrix combinations,&rdquo;&nbsp;adds Lee. This feature is crucial for industries where the virtual testing and design of a composite material is needed.</p>\n\n<p>Research shows that&nbsp;RBHM can reduce overall computation time by up to 70%, which not only improves efficiency but also ensures scalability for large-scale industrial applications. Looking to the future, the university researchers&nbsp;aim to expand RBHM to handle even more complex materials and use cases, including nonlinear elastic behavior and thermoelastic coupling, further broadening its applications in material&nbsp;science.</p>"

This material improves rocket performance by increasing launch vehicle payload capability while reducing production&nbsp;costs compared to industry standard metal-based nozzle extensions.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Firefly&rsquo;s expertise in carbon [fiber] composites and rocket propulsion puts us in a position to develop a composite-based nozzle extension that allow us to reduce mass on our launch vehicles and ultimately increase payload capacity for customers,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve seen with Firefly&rsquo;s carbon [fiber] composite barrels, domes&nbsp;and tanks, composites provide a cost-efficient, lightweight solution that improves performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Second stage nozzle extensions have historically been produced with metals that are often heavy, expensive to manufacture, and reliant on non-domestic sources of raw material. As an alternative, CMC&nbsp;can offer significant cost and mass savings with higher strength at relevant temperature ranges. In fact, Firefly&rsquo;s composite material solution is expected to reduce the mass of nozzle extensions by more than 50%, unlocking additional performance and payload capability. In addition, use of composite materials&nbsp;offers significant lead time reduction from months to weeks with domestically available materials and a rapid spin form production process. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Firefly says it will use its its expertise to rapidly design, build&nbsp;and test a composite-based nozzle extension to validate the material. Once developed and validated, the composite nozzle extensions will enable future responsive space applications that support U.S. national security and the larger commercial space industry. Firefly also plans to use the composite nozzle extension fabrication methods for its second stage engines, Lightning and Vira, that power Firefly&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Alpha</em> rocket&nbsp;and medium launch vehicle (MLV), respectively.</p>"
