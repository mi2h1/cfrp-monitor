Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving\nPDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that\ndirectly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher\nrunning cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide\nmaterial design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead\nis amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a\nfocus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,\nHelmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we\npropose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.\nOur method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,\nwhich analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to\nits effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes\nand analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast\nExpansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels\nfrom structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave\npropagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful\nsensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE\nkernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE\nsolution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements\nthat are more accessible in material development contexts.",

    "summary": "Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive\ntesting (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial\ncomponents. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches\nemploy non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the\nlatent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness\nin downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this\npaper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding\nframework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate,\nnon-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured\nlatent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to\nguide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA\ncomponents while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic\nsignals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we\npropose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability\nfor defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed\nPCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on\nPVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\nand neural network-based metrics.",

      "value": "Active Infrared thermography (AIRT) is a widely adopted non-destructive\ntesting (NDT) technique for detecting subsurface anomalies in industrial\ncomponents. Due to the high dimensionality of AIRT data, current approaches\nemploy non-linear autoencoders (AEs) for dimensionality reduction. However, the\nlatent space learned by AIRT AEs lacks structure, limiting their effectiveness\nin downstream defect characterization tasks. To address this limitation, this\npaper proposes a principal component analysis guided (PCA-guided) autoencoding\nframework for structured dimensionality reduction to capture intricate,\nnon-linear features in thermographic signals while enforcing a structured\nlatent space. A novel loss function, PCA distillation loss, is introduced to\nguide AIRT AEs to align the latent representation with structured PCA\ncomponents while capturing the intricate, non-linear patterns in thermographic\nsignals. To evaluate the utility of the learned, structured latent space, we\npropose a neural network-based evaluation metric that assesses its suitability\nfor defect characterization. Experimental results show that the proposed\nPCA-guided AE outperforms state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods on\nPVC, CFRP, and PLA samples in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),\nand neural network-based metrics."
