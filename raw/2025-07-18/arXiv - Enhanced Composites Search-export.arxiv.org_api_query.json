Characterizations by SEM and TEM\nmicroscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and\ndynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology\nand structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to\nexplain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects\nthose properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the\npolymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer\nchains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant\nstructures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe\nthe conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general\neffective media theory was introduced.

    "summary": "In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by\nincorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the\ndesired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending\nmodule with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The\nSMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new\nstrain-limiting layer. A simple closed-loop control algorithm was used to\nregulate the bending angle of the soft robot within its workspace. A camera was\nutilized to measure the angular changes in the vertical plane. Different\nangles, ranging from 0 to 65 degrees, were covered to evaluate the performance\nof the module and the bending angle control algorithm. The experimental tests\ndemonstrate that using the SMA wire results in more precise control of bending\nin the vertical plane. In addition, it is possible to bend more with less\nworking pressure. The error range was reduced from an average of 5 degrees to 2\ndegrees, and the rise time was reduced from an average of 19 seconds to 3\nseconds.",

      "value": "In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by\nincorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the\ndesired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending\nmodule with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The\nSMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new\nstrain-limiting layer.
