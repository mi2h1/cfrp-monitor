    "summary": "Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying\ntemperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and\nreliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment\napplications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage\nmechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at\nambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix\ndebonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading\nresidual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of\nsubsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology,\ninterface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization\nand life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a\nnewly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography\n(FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures\nwith depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography.\nHowever, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and\nlateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of\ndamage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer\nlearning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network\n(IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based\non limited thermographic datasets.",

Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method\nenhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by\nenabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model\nretraining.

    "summary": "We investigate composite biopolymer networks composed of co-polymerized\nfibrin and gelatin networks and perform rheological measurements over a broad\nparameter space including strain amplitudes that go beyond the linear response\nregime. One goal of the work presented here is to provide a prototypical\nbiocomposite material with highly separable polymerization times and controlled\nnonlinear rheological characteristics. We then extend the Sequence of Physical\nProcesses (SPP)\\cite{Rogers2017} into a statistical and geometrical framework\nthat fingerprints the nonlinear rheological response of biopolymer composite\ngels. Our analysis is based on the changes in the shape of the time-dependent\nCole-Cole plots that allow to reduce the time resolved analysis of the SPP\nmethod into the transition between linear and nonlinear behavior as the\nrheological parameters are varied. While the results clearly highlight how the\nmechanical responses of individual constituents are not simply additive, our\nextended SPP analysis provides a robust and intuitive classification scheme for\ncomparing the nonlinear response of composite materials subjected to large\noscillatory strain.",

      "value": "We investigate composite biopolymer networks composed of co-polymerized\nfibrin and gelatin networks and perform rheological measurements over a broad\nparameter space including strain amplitudes that go beyond the linear response\nregime. One goal of the work presented here is to provide a prototypical\nbiocomposite material with highly separable polymerization times and controlled\nnonlinear rheological characteristics. We then extend the Sequence of Physical\nProcesses (SPP)\\cite{Rogers2017} into a statistical and geometrical framework\nthat fingerprints the nonlinear rheological response of biopolymer composite\ngels. Our analysis is based on the changes in the shape of the time-dependent\nCole-Cole plots that allow to reduce the time resolved analysis of the SPP\nmethod into the transition between linear and nonlinear behavior as the\nrheological parameters are varied. While the results clearly highlight how the\nmechanical responses of individual constituents are not simply additive, our\nextended SPP analysis provides a robust and intuitive classification scheme for\ncomparing the nonlinear response of composite materials subjected to large\noscillatory strain."

    "summary": "Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for\nStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their\nintegration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted\nto enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.",

    "summary": "SiC fibre with the transverse isotropic properties is very important to it\nreinforced metal matrix composites. In this paper, local texture of the CVD SiC\nfibre was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession\nelectron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The result\nfrom XRD is in agreement with the result obtained from PED. And the result\nshown that at the first stage of deposition, the preferred direction of SiC\ngrains is almost random and the distribution of grain size is scattered. At the\nsecond and third stages of deposition, there are two kinds of texture in SiC\nfibre, that is, (110),111. and (110),115.. Furthermore, the grain size at the\nsecond and third stages is about 200 nm and it is lower at the third stage than\nat the second stage because of the lower temperature at the third stage.

In this paper, local texture of the CVD SiC\nfibre was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and precession\nelectron diffraction (PED) on transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The result\nfrom XRD is in agreement with the result obtained from PED. And the result\nshown that at the first stage of deposition, the preferred direction of SiC\ngrains is almost random and the distribution of grain size is scattered. At the\nsecond and third stages of deposition, there are two kinds of texture in SiC\nfibre, that is, (110),111. and (110),115..

In contrast to the\nwell-understood local effective medium response, the properties of\nnanostructured composites can be dominated by electromagnetic nonlocality.

We develop an\nanalytical description of these regimes and show that the behavior of\nmetamaterials in the limits of vanishing nonlocality and of vanishing component\nsize do not commute.
