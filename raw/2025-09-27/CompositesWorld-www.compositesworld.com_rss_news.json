This year, the sixth-generation family business celebrates nearly two centuries of papermaking excellence and advanced materials, with festivities at its Burneside mill, where employees and their families came together to honor a legacy built across generations.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 1845, James Cropper has grown from its Cumbrian roots in Burneside to a global group, with sites in Cornwall, Crewe&nbsp;and Schenectady in the U.S. Across generations, its people have earned an international reputation for color mastery, craftsmanship, technical excellence and sustainable innovation, a culture that continues to define the business today.</p>\n\n<p>That spirit of restless curiosity has shaped defining moments in the company&rsquo;s history: producing paper for the British government during WWI, supplying the iconic red paper for Remembrance Day poppies and welcoming Her Majesty The Queen in 2013 to open the CupCycling&nbsp;plant,&nbsp;a facility dedicated to recycling coffee cups at scale.</p>\n\n<p>Today, that same mindset drives the company&rsquo;s work in advanced materials. From high-performance nonwovens and electrochemical materials used to deliver clean energy, aerospace and medical applications, to molded fiber packaging that accelerates the shift to circular packaging, James Cropper&rsquo;s aim is to help address some of the world&rsquo;s most urgent challenges.</p>\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s passion for color remains strong. Since creating its first colored paper in the 1850s, it has honed its craft. Its state-of-the art color lab now offers more than 2,000 live shades, including 184 blacks and 62 whites, with limitless potential for designers and brands. Most recently, it unveiled Coloursource, a collection of 50 signature shades available in a variety of weights and embossed patterns.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0925-cw-news-JamesCropper-180-years.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0925-cw-news-JamesCropper-180-years.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our story has never been about standing still,&rdquo; says David Stirling, CEO at James Cropper. &ldquo;For 180 years, change, challenge and creativity have been our fuel. The dedication, curiosity and skill of our people continue to shape the future of sustainable materials and advanced technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Burneside site remains at the heart of the group, a center of excellence for manufacturing, innovation&nbsp;and sustainability, located within the Lake District&rsquo;s UNESCO World Heritage landscape.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As James Cropper marks its 180<sup>th</sup> anniversary, the focus is firmly on the future. With two core divisions driving its next chapter &mdash; Advanced Materials and Paper &amp; Packaging &mdash;&nbsp;the company is expanding into high-growth markets, from clean energy and next-generation battery technology to sustainable luxury packaging, while strengthening its role as a trusted partner to global brands, designers and manufacturers&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;standing ready to make a&nbsp;material difference for another 180 years and beyond.</p>"

The flight took off from Archer&rsquo;s test facility in Salinas, and represents the latest milestone in <em>Midnight</em>&rsquo;s envelope expansion testing program.</p>\n\n<p>This flight marked one in a series of upcoming aircraft performance test flights designed to test and showcase <em>Midnight</em>&rsquo;s operational range &mdash; electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, like <em>Midnight</em>, are primarily intended to operate in and around cities at altitudes between 1,500 and 4,000 feet. However, having the operational capability to operate at higher altitudes provides flexibility for managing air traffic in high-density environments and enables these aircraft to be able to operate in certain cities at elevation.</p>\n\n<p>During this flight, <em>Midnight</em>&rsquo;s test pilot conducted a steady climb after takeoff, leveled off at altitude, then continued to fly for 45 miles in total at speeds in excess of 120 miles per hour. The achievement follows <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-completes-longest-flight-for-piloted-midnight-aircraft\" target=\"_blank\">August&rsquo;s&nbsp;record-setting flight</a>&nbsp;in which the aircraft covered approximately 55 miles in 31 minutes at speeds exceeding 126 miles per hour.</p>\n\n<p>Test pilots will continue to safely and methodically test <em>Midnight</em>&rsquo;s speed, duration and mission profiles to prepare for early commercial operations.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Acceleration updates</h3>\n\n<p>On Sept. 12, Archer said it is aiming to participate in the newly established eVTOL Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) alongside U.S. airlines, including&nbsp; United Airlines, and interested cities. This is the first federal initiative designed specifically to accelerate real-world electric air taxi operations in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The trials are expected to focus on demonstrating that eVTOL operations are safe, quiet and scalable &mdash; key factors in building community trust and support for adoption of this new technology.</p>\n</div>"

This study, based on high-quality primary and experimental data sourced from the project&rsquo;s partners, provides a comprehensive and data-driven assessment of innovative recycling processes for composites derived from EOL blades, a topic of increasing importance in the transition to a circular economy. The study included a detailed hotspot analysis, providing actionable insights for reducing environmental impacts across different process phases.</p>\n\n<p>Conducted by the project&rsquo;s coordinator&nbsp;Rina&nbsp;Consulting (Genova, Italy) in the initial&nbsp;phase of the project, the analysis followed ISO 14040 and 14044 standards. The functional unit for the analysis was defined as the recycling of 1 ton of EOL wind turbine blades, and covered REFRESH&rsquo;s&nbsp;three main recycling processes: mechanical recycling&nbsp;and two thermal processes, pyrolysis and microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MW-pyrolysis).</p>\n\n<p>Calculations were performed using the GaBi LCA for Expert software. The study focused on three main impact categories: climate change,&nbsp;resource use (fossils)&nbsp;and resource use (minerals and metals). The characterization method used was the Environmental Footprint (EF) 3.1 method, which is aligned with the latest standards and EU recommendations.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the comprehensive LCA provided&nbsp;a thorough evaluation of the environmental impacts across the entire lifespan of the recycling processes.&nbsp;<br />\nMechanical recycling demonstrated a 2% reduction in environmental impact compared to landfilling. Despite the relatively low percentage reduction, it is important to highlight the generation of secondary raw materials through the recycling process.</p>\n\n<p>The thermal recycling processes, pyrolysis and microwave-assisted pyrolysis, demonstrated a 71% and 72% reduction in climate change impact, respectively, compared to incineration. This highlights the potential of these processes for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n\n<p>The study also revealed that the environmental benefits of using recycled fibers in relevant industries (for example, lightweight structures and&nbsp;textiles) as secondary raw materials, were significantly greater than the impacts associated with the recycling processes themselves. This means that although recycling involves energy consumption and emissions, avoiding the impacts associated with production of virgin fibers (which is typically energy-intensive and resource-demanding) results in a net environmental gain. Therefore, substituting virgin materials with recycled fibers represents a significantly more sustainable option.</p>\n\n<p>All three recycling processes demonstrate significant environmental benefits compared to the impact of the recycling process itself. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the global warming potential (GWP) benefits offered by the mechanical recycling and thermal recycling processes.</p>\n\n<p>This initial LCA analysis indicates that the REFRESH recycling processes have the potential to significantly reduce environmental impacts compared to traditional disposal methods. The environmental benefits of using recycled materials further support the project&rsquo;s goals of promoting circular economy practices and reducing reliance on virgin materials. Next steps involve optimizing these&nbsp;processes, assessing the final use of the recycled materials and conducting an economic and social assessment to maximize REFRESH&rsquo;s sustainability potential.</p>"

Together, the companies will&nbsp;repurpose difficult-to-recycle CFRP&nbsp;waste into advanced components and establish a fully integrated supply chain for rCF-based products, reducing reliance on virgin carbon fiber&nbsp;and lowering raw material costs and carbon footprint.</p>\n\n<p>The partnership will deliver integrated solutions for clean energy sector needs, targeting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lithium-ion batteries (rCF as a cost-effective, partial replacement for synthetic graphite anodes)</li>\n\t<li>Flow and metal-air batteries (rCF felts as high-performance, freestanding electrodes)</li>\n\t<li>Fuel cells and&nbsp;electrolyzers (rCF nonwovens and composites for efficient gas diffusion layers and dense bipolar plates)</li>\n\t<li>Structural power (multifunctional rCF composites capable of storing energy while bearing mechanical loads).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>According to Gen 2 Carbon and Americarb, commercial users &mdash; including battery, fuel cell&nbsp;and electrolyzer manufacturers &mdash; will benefit from 20-30% cost savings compared to virgin fiber alternatives; matching or exceeding performance in demanding energy applications; up to 95% lower carbon footprint (based on life cycle analysis); and enhanced supply chain resilience by leveraging abundant domestic CFRP waste.</p>\n\n<p>This approach also targets the acceleration of&nbsp;green hydrogen deployment and adoption, transportation electrification, renewables&nbsp;integration into modern grids and circular economy practices that turn industry waste into strategic resources.</p>"
