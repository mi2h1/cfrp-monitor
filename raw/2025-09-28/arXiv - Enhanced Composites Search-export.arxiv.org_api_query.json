Precision detection and quantification of\nsubsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology,\ninterface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization\nand life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a\nnewly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography\n(FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures\nwith depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography.\nHowever, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and\nlateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of\ndamage size measurement.

The drone frame weighs\nonly 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing\nstructural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three\nminutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under\noperational conditions.

    "summary": "Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck\nin industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced\nvia non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a\nnovel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert\ncharacterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language\nrepresentations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with\npre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual\nmicrostructural data and textual expert assessments into shared\nrepresentations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we\ndevelop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both\npositive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their\nassociated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of\npreviously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.\nValidation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and\ndefective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method\nenhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by\nenabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model\nretraining.

      "value": "Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck\nin industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced\nvia non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a\nnovel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert\ncharacterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language\nrepresentations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with\npre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual\nmicrostructural data and textual expert assessments into shared\nrepresentations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we\ndevelop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both\npositive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their\nassociated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of\npreviously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.\nValidation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and\ndefective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria.
