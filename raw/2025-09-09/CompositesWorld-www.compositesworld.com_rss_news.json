With an annual capacity of 2,800 tonnes, the facility will become the company&rsquo;s first commercial-scale plant dedicated to the recycling of wind turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p>The financing package consists of a combination of public grants and private capital: an EU Horizon grant awarded in December 2022, two project contributions from Innovation Norway, and a final tranche of NOK 8.6 million (approx. $858,000) through a mix of debt and a share issue that attracted eight local and regional investors. This final step was the decisive piece that completed the company&rsquo;s aforementioned financing package.</p>\n\n<p>Gjenkraft highlights a proprietary pyrolysis technology that is capable of recycling close to 100% of wind turbine blade materials &mdash; including glass fiber, carbon fiber, oils, foams&nbsp;and metals &mdash;&nbsp;turning them into valuable raw materials. The technology delivers significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to incineration, while eliminating the need for landfilling and reducing the extraction of virgin raw materials.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the financing secured, we can now build a commercial production plant that is both economically sustainable and industrially competitive,&rdquo; notes Arvid L&oslash;nne, chairman of Gjenkraft. &ldquo;This provides a solid foundation for further growth in Norway and across Europe.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the H&oslash;yanger facility, Gjenkraft is positioning itself for further expansion across Europe, with ambitions to establish multiple plants and reach a total capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year by 2035.</p>\n\n<p>For related content, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/wind-blade-recycling-project-presents-objectives-progress\">Wind blade recycling project presents objectives, progress</a>&rdquo; or learn more about&nbsp;Gjenkraft on our <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/kc/sustainability/composites-suppliers-resource\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainability page</a>.</p>"

The new name marks the&nbsp;company&rsquo;s transition to a standalone, privately held business and reflects its legacy in lightweight composite solutions.</p>\n\n<p>As part of this transformation, the company has unveiled a new logo (shown above) and is retiring the historical &ldquo;Continental Structural Plastics&rdquo; name. The new tagline,&nbsp;&ldquo;The Composites Solution Partner,&rdquo;&nbsp;more accurately conveys CSP&rsquo;s commitment to delivering innovative, high-performance composite solutions to its customers.</p>\n\n<p>The redesigned logo features a sleek, modern aesthetic with thin lines and a forward-leaning stance &mdash; symbolizing motion, mobility&nbsp;and progress. Its lighter design reflects the advanced lightweight materials that define CSP&rsquo;s product portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This transition gave us an opportunity to return to a brand that is well recognized in the industry, while also giving it a fresh, contemporary update,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Kim Zitny, director of corporate communications. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to roll out our new brand identity across advertising, social media&nbsp;and upcoming industry events. A new website will also launch later this year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now operating independently, CSP remains focused on building strong partnerships with leading OEMs and delivering solutions for the transportation industry. CSP will continue its North American operations at the following locations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ohio: Carey, Conneaut, North Baltimore, Van Wert</li>\n\t<li>North Carolina: Lenoir, Salisbury</li>\n\t<li>Louisiana: Sarepta</li>\n\t<li>Indiana: Grabill, Huntington</li>\n\t<li>Texas: Seguin</li>\n\t<li>Michigan: Auburn Hills (two&nbsp;locations), Manchester</li>\n\t<li>Mexico: Saltillo, Tijuana.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that CSP&rsquo;s operations are limited to North America. The European operations previously under Teijin Automotive Technologies are not part of this transition and remain separate.</p>"

This enables the company to further expand its operations in the Asia-Pacific region, specifically Australia. Gurit plans to&nbsp;open a new facility to support this new contract, and take the opportunity to relocate its&nbsp;current distribution facility to the new site, expected to be near Brisbane, Queensland. This agreement is projected to generate a low to mid double-digit million CHF in sales within 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>Corecell is a high-performing structural core material based on styrene acrylonitrile resin (SAN), originally developed by Gurit in the 1980s. It has since undergone numerous improvements. Gurit&nbsp;says it&nbsp;&ldquo;remains unmatched in the marketplace,&rdquo; with a long history of success in extremely high-performance and demanding applications.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This contract marks a significant step in our ongoing strategic realignment, accelerating our transformation into a dynamic, multi-market company,&rdquo; says Lance Hill, general manager marine and industrial, Gurit.&nbsp;&ldquo;This long-term partnership demonstrates our commitment to diversification beyond traditional markets, leveraging our expertise in advanced composites solutions to capture new opportunities across multiple industries.&rdquo;</p>"

The project is now attracting interest from aerospace and defense organizations, which are seeking to explore its potential applications.</p>\n\n<p>Ultima Forma have developed&nbsp;a leading edge&nbsp;protection layer through a process called electroforming, which involves electric currents depositing a thin layer of metal onto a substrate. Polar Technology is an expert&nbsp;in design and manufacture of critical composite products and is&nbsp;working closely on the best method to integrate this electroform into the structure.</p>\n\n<p>All aspects of the process can be carefully controlled, with thickness and dimensions tailored depending on the application. An additional ambition of the project&nbsp;is to develop a U.K.-based manufacture and distribution network for leading edge protection solutions, including the manufacture of the composite structure itself, which will ultimately shorten and simplify the supply chain process.</p>\n\n<p>A number of milestones have been hit since the project launched, including confirmation that the nickel-cobalt LEEF layers maintain high&nbsp;hardness when tested up to 900&deg;C and beyond 1,000+ hours of ASTM B117 salt spray testing, delivering optimal performance for high-temperature platforms and mission-critical components.</p>\n\n<p>Scalable parts manufacturing is underway, with the electroformed leading edges integrating seamlessly with composite aerofoils as co-molded or secondary bonded structures, enabling faster builds and retrofit flexibility.</p>\n\n<p>Three key use cases have been identified as ideal demonstrators of the technology: rotor and propeller blades for eVTOL&nbsp;aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, aerofoils for turbine inlets and outlet guide vanes for aircraft engines. All three cases are based on geometries provided by OEM customers in the aerospace and defense industries, which illustrates the planned routes to market. From the smallest ISR drone to the largest tactical transport,&nbsp;LEEFs&nbsp;has demonstrated delivery of lightweight, high-durability protection against rain, ice, sand and bird strikes.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We know the market is striving for scale on a competitive level without compromising on performance or quality,&rdquo; says Daniel Chilcott, business development director at Polar Technology. &ldquo;This technology and collaboration has the potential to make it&nbsp;a reality.&rdquo;</p>"
