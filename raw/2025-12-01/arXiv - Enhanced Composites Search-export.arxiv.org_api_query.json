Here, we demonstrate a purely mechanical route to rhythmic DNA reorganization in a minimal active composite of microtubules, kinesin motors, and DNA. We embed a DNA polymer in an active turbulent microtubule-kinesin fluid, creating a self-morphing material. The active flows stretch and entangle the DNA, forming a self-organized viscoelastic network that resists active stresses and affects flow over large length scales. This mechanical feedback loop progressively amplifies velocity correlations and drives a nonequilibrium phase transition tuned by DNA contour length: from disordered flow to synchronized, millimeter-scale oscillations with vortices. We rationalize the phase transition with an active-gel model that predicts a growing length scale and an oscillatory instability emerging from the interplay between activity, orientational order, and self-generated viscoelasticity, rather than chemical signaling. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on system size and activity quantitatively agrees with experiment. Thus, flow-driven DNA remodeling provides a minimal physical route to autonomous, system-spanning oscillations in three dimensions and suggests design principles for programmable soft matter that coordinates, actuates, and reshapes itself.",

    "summary": "Double perovskites (DPs) are promising candidates for sustainable energy technologies due to their compositional tunability and compatibility with low-energy fabrication, yet their vast design space poses a major challenge for conditional materials discovery. This work introduces a multi-agent, text gradient-driven framework that performs DP composition generation under natural-language conditions by integrating three complementary feedback sources: LLM-based self-evaluation, DP-specific domain knowledge-informed feedback, and ML surrogate-based feedback. Analogous to how knowledge-informed machine learning improves the reliability of conventional data-driven models, our framework incorporates domain-informed text gradients to guide the generative process toward physically meaningful regions of the DP composition space. Systematic comparison of three incremental configurations, (i) pure LLM generation, (ii) LLM generation with LLM reasoning-based feedback, and (iii) LLM generation with domain knowledge-guided feedback, shows that iterative guidance from knowledge-informed gradients improves stability-condition satisfaction without additional training data, achieving over 98% compositional validity and up to 54% stable or metastable candidates, surpassing both the LLM-only baseline (43%) and prior GAN-based results (27%). Analyses of ML-based gradients further reveal that they enhance performance in in-distribution (ID) regions but become unreliable in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Overall, this work provides the first systematic analysis of multi-agent, knowledge-guided text gradients for DP discovery and establishes a generalizable blueprint for MAS-driven generative materials design aimed at advancing sustainable technologies.",

In this paper, we investigate the chemical factors that control the stability of Li-NASICONs and garnets in highly alkaline aqueous environment. While this is of general importance, it is particularly important for the operation of Li-air cells with humidified air. Humid air promotes the formation of LiOH as the discharge product, creating a highly alkaline environment on the surface of cathode and solid-state electrolyte. In this work, we combine machine learning and first-principles calculations to conduct a high-throughput computational screening of alkaline-stable oxide-based Li-ion conductors in order to better characterize the tradeoff between the various relevant properties. We evaluate the material stability in terms of pH, voltage, and species present in the environment (LiOH and H2O) across a vast range of chemical compositions with NASICON and garnet crystal structures. We utilize the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential for pre-screening, followed by DFT calculations. Such a hierarchical screening procedure enables the evaluation of over 320,000 chemical compositions, encompassing nearly the entire periodic table. From this set 209 alkaline-stable NASICON and garnet compounds are selected as final candidates. We identify the specific cation substitutions that improve alkaline stability in NASICON and garnet compounds, and reveal the underlying mechanism. We also discover the trade-offs for designing alkaline-stable Li-ion conductors, highlighting the need to carefully optimize compositions so that it can simultaneously enhance all the material properties required for practical battery applications.",

We utilize the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential for pre-screening, followed by DFT calculations. Such a hierarchical screening procedure enables the evaluation of over 320,000 chemical compositions, encompassing nearly the entire periodic table. From this set 209 alkaline-stable NASICON and garnet compounds are selected as final candidates. We identify the specific cation substitutions that improve alkaline stability in NASICON and garnet compounds, and reveal the underlying mechanism. We also discover the trade-offs for designing alkaline-stable Li-ion conductors, highlighting the need to carefully optimize compositions so that it can simultaneously enhance all the material properties required for practical battery applications."

We identify several promising candidates and compare their projected dark matter detection sensitivity for all possible interactions identified within effective field theory.

Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation.

Here, phase-field simulations of hard/soft ferrite composites (BaM/NiZn) clarify how exchange coupling and microstructure impact magnetic permeability. We show that particle size, volume fraction, and orientation of the hard phase can effectively control the transition from collinear to non-collinear coupling, with a critical exchange size r_cr approximately 12 nm. Increasing the hard-phase fraction deepens the anisotropy energy well and monotonically suppresses permeability. In contrast, rotating the BaM easy axis to 90 degrees relative to the applied field produces a strong enhancement: at a 10 nm radius and eta = 0.1 volume fraction, the effective permeability can be more than 30 times larger than in the parallel configuration and then saturates for larger particles.

    "summary": "Layered \"mosaic\" metal-halide perovskite materials display a wide-variety of microstructures that span the order-disorder spectrum and can be tuned via the composition of their constituent B-site octahedral species. Such materials are typically modeled using computationally expensive ab initio methods, but these approaches are greatly limited to small sample sizes. Here, we develop a highly efficient hard-particle packing algorithm to model large samples of these layered complex alloys that enables an accurate determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the B-site arrangements within the plane of the inorganic layers across length scales. Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive \"mixing\" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed. In summary, our packing model and mixing metric enable one to accurately explore the enormous space of hypothetical layered mosaic alloy compositions and identify materials with potentially desirable optoelectronic and magnetic properties.",

    "summary": "Protoplanetary disks inherit their chemical composition from their natal molecular cloud, but the extent to which this material is preserved versus reset through chemical reprocessing remains an open question. Understanding this balance is a major topic in astrochemistry. Comparing the chemical composition of the envelope and the protoplanetary disk is key to solving the topic. The goal of this paper is to investigate the chemical differences between the disk and the surrounding envelope by comparing the column density ratios of a few selected species in each region. The source we focus on is HL Tau. We present new NOEMA observations of HL Tau targeting the following species: CS, H2CO, H2S, and SO2. We produced zeroth-, first-, and second-moment maps for the species where emission was detected and used them to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the different molecules in the disk and the envelope. We derived the column densities and compared the values derived for the envelope and disk. We also computed the rotational diagram for the SO2 detected transitions. Assuming two different temperature regimes, 17 and 58 K, we derived column densities for the species surveyed in the disk and compared them with values derived for the envelope. We find large differences in the derived column density ratios of the surveyed molecules, especially for N(CS)/N(H2S), which is 40 to 50 times larger in the envelope. We attribute these variations to the different excitation and UV-irradiation regimes in the disk and envelope. We also note strong gradients in the ratios between different positions of the disk and tentatively attribute them to different levels of turbulence at different azimuths. The observed differences in molecular ratios in the envelope and the disk are suggestive of chemical reprocessing of the gas during the formation and evolution of the protoplanetary disk.",

    "summary": "Conventional $J_c$-enhancement methods like doping and irradiation often introduce extrinsic elements or defects, altering intrinsic properties. Here, we report a significant $J_c$ enhancement in FeSe single crystals through compressive strain applied using a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic substrate with anisotropic thermal contraction during cooling. Under zero field at 2 K, $J_{\\text{c}}$ increases by a factor of $\\sim$4 from $\\sim 2.3 \\times 10^{4}$ to $\\sim 8.7 \\times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$; at 5 T, it achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement, rising from $\\sim 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$ to $\\sim 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$. Analysis based on the Dew-Hughes model of the $f_{\\text{p}}$(h) relationship shows that strain strengthens vortex pinning, and shifts the pinning mechanism from point-like pinning to combined point and surface pinnings. This work offers an effective method to enhance FeSe's current-carrying limitation, deepens understanding of iron-based superconductors' pinning mechanisms, and highlights strain engineering's potential for optimizing superconducting performance.",

      "value": "Conventional $J_c$-enhancement methods like doping and irradiation often introduce extrinsic elements or defects, altering intrinsic properties. Here, we report a significant $J_c$ enhancement in FeSe single crystals through compressive strain applied using a glass-fiber-reinforced plastic substrate with anisotropic thermal contraction during cooling. Under zero field at 2 K, $J_{\\text{c}}$ increases by a factor of $\\sim$4 from $\\sim 2.3 \\times 10^{4}$ to $\\sim 8.7 \\times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$; at 5 T, it achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement, rising from $\\sim 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$ to $\\sim 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$ A cm$^{-2}$. Analysis based on the Dew-Hughes model of the $f_{\\text{p}}$(h) relationship shows that strain strengthens vortex pinning, and shifts the pinning mechanism from point-like pinning to combined point and surface pinnings. This work offers an effective method to enhance FeSe's current-carrying limitation, deepens understanding of iron-based superconductors' pinning mechanisms, and highlights strain engineering's potential for optimizing superconducting performance."

Icy bodies display a remarkable diversity of geological, geophysical, and atmospheric processes, which differ fundamentally from those of the rocky terrestrial planets. Evidence from past and ongoing spacecraft missions has revealed subsurface oceans, cryovolcanic activity, and tenuous but persistent atmospheres, showing that icy bodies are active and evolving worlds. At the same time, major questions remain unresolved, including the chemical properties of icy materials, the geological histories of their surfaces, and the coupling between internal evolution and orbital dynamics. Current knowledge of the surfaces, interiors, and atmospheres of the principal icy bodies is built on spacecraft measurements, telescopic observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. Recent contributions from Juno, JWST, and stellar occultation studies have added valuable constraints on atmospheric composition, interior structure, and surface activity. Looking ahead, missions such as JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe are expected to deliver substantial progress in the study of icy bodies. Their findings, combined with continued Earth- and space-based observations and laboratory studies, will be critical for assessing the potential habitability of these environments and for placing them within a broader framework of planetary system formation and evolution.",

    "summary": "Understanding physical properties such as friction, stiffness, hardness, and material composition is essential for enabling robots to interact safely and effectively with their surroundings. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods focus on geometry and appearance and cannot infer these underlying physical properties. We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines. Our results demonstrate that PhysGS unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single, spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation.

Using these phase diagrams, we engineer the composition NdFe$_{1.15}$Co$_{0.46}$Ni$_{2.39}$B to maximize the MCE. Interestingly, the Nd$T_4$B system shows a notable entropy change over a wide temperature range ($\\sim$10 to 650 K), and particular compositions have notable MCEs spanning hundreds of Kelvin, making this a suitable system to study for technologies used in a wide range of temperatures.

While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning.

Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.",

However, even when both the crystal structure and chemical composition are fixed, material properties can still vary depending on the atomic arrangements (configurations) at crystallographic sites. To support detailed material design, we present PyAPX, a Python toolkit that performs Bayesian searches of stable atomic configurations. A distinctive feature of this initial release is the introduction of encoding methods suitable for configuration search, and we evaluate their performance using the h-BCN system. As a result, they were confirmed to yield superior convergence compared to commonly used one-hot encoding. PyAPX is broadly applicable to crystalline materials and is expected to further advance materials discovery.",

Much of thermoplastic design has been focused on the short-time response associated with the dynamical rigidity of rubbery or glassy chains. However, less attention has been paid to the long-time relaxation and rigidity of microphase separated BCP melts or the role that domain morphology plays in modulating near-equilibrium response. We take advantage of the ability of self-consistent field theory (SCFT) to calculate equilibrium properties of BCP melts to explore the anisotropic elastic response of ordered ABA and AB copolymer melts as quasistatic deformation processes. This allows us to determine the anisotropic stiffness of the liquid crystal-like lamellar and columnar phases due to modulations in domain spacing, as well as the full stiffness tensor of the cubic BCC sphere and double gyroid phases. We explore elastic modulus landscapes for both single grain materials and random polycrystals over architectural parameters and segregation strengths, using AB diblock and ABA triblock melts as key examples. Finally, we re-examine basic assumptions of BCP melts as simple composites, dependence of melt stiffness on domain spacing, and the role of bridging chain conformations in altering melt relaxation, providing evidence for an interplay between mass transport and domain topology that remains to be understood.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a pedagogical and conceptual account of the course AI in Music and Sound: Modalities, Tools and Creative Applications, offered within the Music Informatics and Media Art module of an M.Sc. in Audio Communication. The course engaged students with a range of AI modalities such as symbolic composition, voice synthesis, timbre transfer, neural audio synthesis, and text-to-audio systems, combining theoretical reflection with practice-based experimentation. Its central pedagogical move is a paired-études design: each modality is approached first through its intended affordances and then through a deliberately reframed or \"misused\" exercise that surfaces representational limits and alternative behaviours. Framed by medium theory and post-structuralist inquiry, we treated AI as a transmodal conduit-a system that translates and perturbs musical signs across textual, symbolic, timbral and audio domains. Evidence from student work and reflection indicates growth in technical fluency, medium awareness, and critical literacy, alongside the cultivation of experimental method and process-oriented listening. The paper outlines the course architecture, assessment design, and representative projects, and distils a set of design patterns for AI-music pedagogy (eg., prompt-conditioned interplays and semantic destabilisation in text-to-audio; latent space materialism in timbre transfer). It concludes with pedagogical recommendations that integrate creative practice with medium awareness and with cultural-epistemic analysis of AI technologies, preparing students to participate in how AI is understood, developed, and deployed with creative communities.",

Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management.

Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological \"pins\" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.",

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.",

However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.",

Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the Néel temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.",

    "summary": "Proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) achieve high efficiency at reduced operating temperatures, but their performance is often limited by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. The BaCoFeZrY (BCFZY) perovskite family is a promising triple-conducting air-electrode material, yet the role of Y dopants in governing oxygen transport remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effect of Y content on oxygen conductivity in three compositions: BCFZ, BCFZY0.1, and BCFY. Oxygen conductivity was evaluated from the product of oxygen tracer diffusivity and oxygen defect concentration. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine tracer diffusivity and migration energies, while defect concentrations were estimated from reference data. Y doping slightly decreases oxygen conductivity from BCFZ to BCFZY0.1, from 337 to 203 mS/cm at 500 C, with activation energies of 0.155 and 0.172 eV. BCFY shows much lower conductivity (99 mS/cm) and a higher activation energy of 0.261 eV. Computed conductivities are higher and more Arrhenius-like than experimental values, suggesting that microstructural features such as grain boundaries strongly limit oxygen transport in real materials. A series-circuit model combining bulk conductivity and fitted grain-boundary parameters provides semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. These results clarify the role of Y doping in oxygen transport and provide insight for optimizing cathode performance in PCFCs.",

Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising anode material due to the high theoretical capacity of tin. Unlike conventional intercalation based electrodes, SnSe undergoes conversion and alloying reactions with lithium to form Li4.4Sn, Sn, and Li2Se, enabling high lithium storage but inducing large volume changes that cause mechanical instability and capacity fading. Embedding SnSe nanoparticles within a Ti3C2Tx MXene framework offers a strategy to mitigate these effects by enhancing conductivity and structural resilience. Here, cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo FIB) slice and view revealed progressive material redistribution and morphological transformation during cycling, underscoring the need for site specific chemical analysis. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo APT) of selected regions provided high spatial and chemical resolution while preserving beam sensitive phases, uncovering nanoscale degradation mechanisms including phase transformations, partial dissolution of active material, and, importantly, the first direct evidence of copper corrosion and copper ion migration from the current collector into the electrode. The observation of copper redistribution demonstrates that current collector degradation contributes directly to chemical contamination and capacity fading in composite electrodes. Together, cryo FIB and cryo APT provide a powerful workflow for elucidating electrode degradation in reactive, beam sensitive systems, offering critical insights for designing more durable and stable next generation battery materials.",

To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions. By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software. This FE model is used to generate the required design of experiments to train the surrogate models. Within this framework, a comparative performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Kriging surrogate against alternative methods, including polynomial chaos expansion (implemented in UQLab) and support vector regression (SVR).

    "summary": "The discovery of advanced metallic alloys is hindered by vast composition spaces, competing property objectives, and real-world constraints on manufacturability. Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints.",

Here we introduce MATAI, a generalist machine learning framework for property prediction and inverse design of as-cast alloys. MATAI integrates a curated alloy database, deep neural network-based property predictors, a constraint-aware optimization engine, and an iterative AI-experiment feedback loop. The framework estimates key mechanical propertie, sincluding density, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation, directly from composition, using multi-task learning and physics-informed inductive biases. Alloy design is framed as a constrained optimization problem and solved using a bi-level approach that combines local search with symbolic constraint programming. We demonstrate MATAI's capabilities on the Ti-based alloy system, a canonical class of lightweight structural materials, where it rapidly identifies candidates that simultaneously achieve lower density (<4.45 g/cm3), higher strength (>1000 MPa) and appreciable ductility (>5%) through only seven iterations. Experimental validation confirms that MATAI-designed alloys outperform commercial references such as TC4, highlighting the framework's potential to accelerate the discovery of lightweight, high-performance materials under real-world design constraints."

In this study, we investigate how lithological controls influence fault permeability using the PREDICT framework: a probabilistic workflow that couples stochastic fault geometry generation, physically constrained material placement, and flow-based upscaling. The flow-based upscaling step, however, is a very computationally expensive component of the workflow and presents a major bottleneck that makes global sensitivity analysis (GSA) intractable, as it requires millions of model evaluations. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network surrogate to emulate the flow-based upscaling step. This surrogate model dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, thereby making GSA feasible. The surrogate-model-enabled GSA reveals new insights into the effects of lithological controls on fault permeability. In addition to identifying dominant parameters and negligible ones, the analysis uncovers significant nonlinear interactions between parameters that cannot be captured by traditional local sensitivity methods.",

    "summary": "We present a forward prediction material screening framework designed to discover Pd-Cu alloys with improved B2 phase stability, thereby unlocking simultaneous $H_2$ generation and utilization. First, we trained CatBoost models with literature-derived Pd alloy data to predict $H_2$ permeability from composition and testing conditions. We evaluated fractional, composition-based, and physics-informed descriptors, individually and in combination, and showed that sequential Pearson filtering and fold-wise SHAP-based recursive feature elimination with cross-fold aggregation reduced errors while controlling complexity. Guided by the one-SE rule, a narrower domain-informed set of 13 features provided the best accuracy parsimony trade-off ($R^2=0.81$), only 0.01 below the max. $R^2$ achievable with 3x the number of features. SHAP analysis indicated that high permeability is promoted by elevated temperature, lattice expansion relative to Pd, atomic size mismatch, and favorable mixing tendencies. Second, the selected model was applied to screen $Pd_{(100-x-y)}Cu_{x}M_{y}$ spanning 16 co-dopants M for B2 stabilization. For each M system, we obtained the Pareto set of compositions that minimize Pd content and Miedema heat of formation and maximize the permeability, then picked three compounds, including that with the highest predicted permeability, the lowest Miedema heat of formation, and the lowest Pd content. With a final filter considering M concentration for single-phase Pd-M solution formation, we recommend Pd48.48Cu43.00Y8.52, Pd49.08Cu42.45Sc8.47, Pd56.09Cu33.70La10.21, and Pd52.68Cu40.44Mg6.88 for experimental validation.

Here we develop a first-principles-inspired quantum-statistics-based theoretical analysis of the ferroelectric order and interfacial superconductivity in lightly-doped quantum paraelectric, niobium (Nb)-doped KTaO$_3$. We demonstrate that local distortions induced by the doped Nb atoms beyond its quantum critical composition induce a long-range ferroelectric order. The predicted dielectric properties quantitatively agree with the experimental measurements over the entire temperature range from the symmetry-broken ferroelectric phase across the phase transition to the paraelectric region. As the same soft phonon mode that governs dielectric behavior provides the essential pairing channel for interfacial superconductivity of KTaO$_3$, we predict a pronounced enhancement of this superconductivity on (111) surface when the system is tuned to its quantum-critical composition via Nb doping, providing a concrete avenue for experimental verification. This finding establishes ferroelectric quantum criticality as a unique design principle for engineering enhanced superconductivity and discovering emergent quantum phases in polar oxide heterostructures, explicitly suggesting that similar materials-tuning strategies (e.g., epitaxial strain) could be exploited to enhance superconductivity in quantum paraelectric systems.",

    "summary": "The HyperScout-H (HS-H) instrument is one of the payloads aboard ESA's Hera spacecraft. Hera is a planetary defence mission that aims to provide a detailed characterization of the near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos-Dimorphos after the NASA/DART mission impact. HS-H is a versatile dual-use payload, functioning as a hyperspectral imager that captures both images and spectral data within the 0.65--0.95 $μ$m wavelength range. The observations from this instrument will offer key insights regarding the composition of the two bodies Didymos and Dimorphos, space weathering effects, and the potential presence of exogenous material on these asteroids. Thanks to its wide field of view ($\\approx 15.5^\\circ \\times 8.3^\\circ$ in paraxial approximation), HS-H will be able to monitor the system's orbital dynamic and dust environment. At the same time, both components of this binary asteroid remain in the field of view for most of the asteroid phase of the mission. These results also complement the data obtained from other instruments in characterizing the geomorphological units. The data that will be obtained by HS-H will enable the creation of maps highlighting key spectral features, such as taxonomic classification, spectral slope, and band parameters. This article presents the pre-flight calibration of the instrument, outlines the science objectives, and discusses the expected investigations. The instrument's capabilities are demonstrated through laboratory observations of two meteorite samples and a dedicated software toolbox was developed specifically for processing the instrument's data.",

    "summary": "Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet effective and reversible storage remains challenging. AB3-type intermetallic alloys are promising for solid-state hydrogen storage due to intermediate thermodynamic stability and rapid hydrogen uptake. Optimizing stability and gravimetric density is hindered by competing thermodynamic and magnetic effects. Here, we analyze AB3 compounds (A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni) and ternary alloys CaxYyMg1-x-yB3 using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a direct correlation between formation energy and total magnetic moment that dictates alloy stability, explaining the trade-off in hydrogen storage. In Co-rich systems with large lattice volumes, formation energy rises with magnetization, showing magnetism as the dominant factor. Mg-rich compositions achieve high gravimetric densities, but strong magnetism destabilizes the system, requiring Y substitution to suppress magnetic moments. Replacing Co with Ni weakens magnetism: YNi3 is nonmagnetic, while CaNi3 and MgNi3 are weakly polarized, allowing thermodynamic stability across compositions. Notably, CaMg2Ni9 combines high theoretical capacity (3.32 wt%) with good reversibility. Mg-rich Ni-based alloys are predicted to offer negative formation energies with the highest gravimetric densities (up to 3.40 wt%). These results show that controlling magnetism via transition-metal substitution is key to overcoming the stability-capacity trade-off in AB3 hydrogen storage materials.",

These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.",

    "summary": "Hydrothermal synthesis offers an economical and scalable way to produce nanodiamonds under relatively mild, low-pressure and low-temperature conditions. However,its sustainability and the detailed mechanisms behind diamond formation in such environments are still not fully understood. In this work, we designed ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using different CHO-based molecular precursors containing COOH and OH groups, such as organic acids, polyols, sugars, and polysaccharides.The reactions were carried out at 190 degrees Centigrade in chlorinated, strongly alkaline aqueous solutions with alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed the presence of diamond-specific lattice planes and sp3-hybridized carbon structures. Our results show that the type of precursor, its molecular size, and the ionic composition of the solution play key roles in determining the defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the resulting nanodiamonds. Atomic-scale imaging showed both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns. These observations provide direct insight into how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems. Overall, the study positions hydrothermal synthesis as a sustainable, chemistry-driven, and tunable approach for creating nanodiamonds tailored for applications in quantum technologies, biomedicine, catalysis, and advanced materials.",

    "summary": "Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.",

Furthermore, we established a controllable polymicrobial infection model and validated its translational relevance through antibiotic susceptibility profiling and spatial microbiological analyses. Notably, the antibiotic response patterns of the PA/WF-derived biofilms closely mirrored those observed in a rat wound infection in vivo model.

    "summary": "Recently, Ksenofontov et al (arXiv:2510.03256) observed ambient pressure room-temperature superconductivity in graphite intercalated with lithium-based alloys with transition temperature (according to magnetization measurements) $T_c=330$ $K$. Here, I analyzed the reported temperature dependent resistivity data $ρ(T)$ in these graphite-intercalated samples and found that $ρ(T)$ is well described by the model of two series resistors, where each resistor is described as either an Einstein conductor or a Bloch-Grüneisen conductor. Deduced Einstein and Debye temperatures are $Θ_{E,1} \\approx 250$ $K$ and $Θ_{E,2} \\approx 1,600$ $K$, and $Θ_{D,1} \\approx 300$ $K$ and $Θ_{D,2} \\approx 2,200$ $K$, respectively. Following the McMillan formalism, from the deduced $Θ_{E,2}$ and $Θ_{D,2}$, the electron-phonon coupling constant $λ_{e-ph} = 2.2 - 2.6$ was obtained. This value of $λ_{e-ph}$ is approximately equal to the value of $λ_{e-ph}$ in highly compressed superconducting hydrides. Based on this, I can propose that the observed room-temperature superconductivity in intercalated graphite is localized in nanoscale Sr-Ca-Li metallic flakes/particles, which adopt the phonon spectrum from the surrounding bulk graphite matrix, and as a result, conventional electron-phonon superconductivity arises in these nano-flakes/particles at room temperature. Experimental data reported by Ksenofontov et al (arXiv:2510.03256) on trapped magnetic flux decay in intercalated graphite samples supports the proposition.",

    "summary": "The precise identification of neurotransmitters is essential for comprehending cerebral function, detecting neurological conditions, and formulating successful therapeutic approaches. The present work investigates the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/Hβcd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with $Hβcd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with $Hβcd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/Hβcd$ with the layered sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $μ$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $μ$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $μ$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $μ$A $μM^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$.

      "value": "The precise identification of neurotransmitters is essential for comprehending cerebral function, detecting neurological conditions, and formulating successful therapeutic approaches. The present work investigates the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/Hβcd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with $Hβcd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with $Hβcd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/Hβcd$ with the layered sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $μ$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $μ$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $μ$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $μ$A $μM^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone, melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor. Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of $Cu_2S/Hβcd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR."

    "summary": "Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001, which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.",

The method is based on two-directional beam tracking (2DBT), which requires only a single optical element and is compatible with standard x-ray sources and detectors. We validate the system's capabilities through imaging of a custom-built phantom, a fibre-reinforced composite and ex-vivo biological tissues, including a bovine intervertebral disc, a rat heart, and a porcine meniscus. The results show that dark-field tomography provides complementary information to attenuation as well as to phase tomography, by revealing sub-resolution features such as fibre orientation and microstructural heterogeneity at length scales that are well below the voxel size. A key element of our system is its sensitivity to scattering along two orthogonal directions in the image plane, enabling the measurement of scattering anisotropy with a single exposure. As well as simple and robust, our approach is sensitive and precise. These findings demonstrate the potential of 2DBT for non-destructive and three-dimensional structural characterisation of samples and materials in engineering, materials science and biomedical applications.",

    "summary": "Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence of surface contamination in STM measurements.",

Typical computational methodologies such as molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics have limited ability to access the long time scales required for these hierarchical self-assembly processes. Here we adopt a particle-based reaction-diffusion algorithm to model the spatial-temporal evolution of hundreds to thousands of micron-scale DNA-coated colloid self-assembly process over hours. In order to demonstrate the capability of this digital twin, we compared its predicted core-shell assembly process to results from experiments. The model can qualitatively reproduce the core-shell structures observed in experiment by recapitulating the emergence of compositional heterogeneity when delays between distinct assembly times are introduced. These results support the idea that this approach can successfully capture dynamics over long time scales and the appropriate scale of structure formation. We then use the model to explore different protocols for structure evolution, suggesting how this tool can aid in the design of complex self-organization processes.",

Coupled with a crystal graph encoder, contrastive pretraining yields physically grounded representations. XCCP demonstrates strong performance across tasks, with structure retrieval reaching 0.89 and space group identification attains 0.93 accuracy. The framework further generalizes to compositionally similar multi principal element alloys and demonstrates zero-shot transfer to experimental patterns. These results establish XCCP as a robust, interpretable, and scalable approach that offers a new paradigm for X-ray diffraction analysis.

    "summary": "We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states, while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections.

      "value": "We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states, while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics."

Although experimental studies have shown that the interfacial bonding properties of SiCN films vary with SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters, a clear correlation between these parameters and the resulting bonding properties has not yet been established. This study presents an atomistic investigation of SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding with controlled SiCN composition and plasma fluence, which performs O2 plasma surface activation, surface hydroxylation, direct bonding, post-bonding annealing, and debonding using reactive molecular dynamics. The structural characterization of the plasma-activated SiCN surface, including density of various covalent bonds and surface roughness, exhibits composition- and plasma fluence-dependent chemical and morphological modification. Bonding energy evaluated from atomic traction-separation responses in cohesive zone volume elements (CZVE) during debonding simulations shows a positive correlation with the interfacial Si-O-Si density. Since the interfacial Si-O-Si density reflects the combined effects of these chemical and morphological modifications, the dependence of bonding energy on composition and plasma fluence is successfully elucidated by the structural characterization. These results establish an atomic-level material-process-property relationship and offer practical guidance for optimizing SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters for SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding.",

Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm) enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels.

These findings highlight the need to carefully tune experimental parameters to mitigate quantification biases and enhance the reliability of APT analyses for geological materials."

Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.",

Boosting the integrated performance of these hybrid systems demands techniques capable of probing local variations of the physical properties inaccessible to bulk analysis.

Numerical simulations show that the response is dominated by the vertical component of the permittivity and that the decorating metallic Au NP produce only moderate shielding of the semiconductor Bi$_2$S$_3$ NR core, indicating that the large increase in the dielectric response originates primarily from intrinsic modifications within the NR.

    "summary": "The objective of developing bio-based composite sandwich structures with greener core materials is to facilitate the decarbonization of industries such as aviation and maritime. This field of research has received increasing attention over the past decades. For example, balsa wood has emerged as a highly promising alternative to foam or honeycomb cores, offering a lightweight, rapidly renewable and cost-effective solution. However, plant fibers such as balsa wood and flax often display high hydrophilic behavior, which could affect their mechanical performance and long-term durability. It is therefore imperative to promote further research into the characterization of the cyclic hygrothermal aging behavior of balsa wood core sandwich structures, in particular the identification of moistureinduced strains and internal stresses in the skins and cores, as well as the investigation of moisture desorption processes and the associated thermal shrinkage phenomena in wood fibers, resins and glass fibers. Accordingly, this work employs two complete moisture absorption-desorption cycles to characterize the moisture diffusion behavior of specimens comprising three different materials, including the pure balsa wood, resin-infused balsa and balsa core sandwich structures with two Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) skins. The changes in moisture content and hygroscopic strains in the thickness, length and width directions of all specimens were investigated with a view to identifying the hygroscopic swelling and thermal shrinkage behaviors exhibited during long-term aging cycles.",

The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.",
