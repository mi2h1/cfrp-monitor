Source (All Images) |&nbsp;DLR (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/dlr---german-aerospace-center\" target=\"_blank\">German Aerospace Center &ndash; DLR</a> (Cologne) announces that its high-altitude solar aircraft,&nbsp;HAP-alpha, has completed ground vibration testing (GVT),&nbsp;a key milestone in flight readiness, at its National Experimental Test Center in Cochstedt.&nbsp;Further tests will follow and the first low-altitude flight trial is planned for 2026, subject to ideal weather conditions.</p>\n\n<p>HAP-alpha is&nbsp;highly elastic, solar-powered uncrewed aircraft platform designed to operate in Earth&rsquo;s lower stratosphere for&nbsp;extended periods, performing a wide range of observation and communications tasks&nbsp;from monitoring shipping lanes and supporting disaster response to providing internet access. The structure, weighing only&nbsp;138 kilograms&nbsp;and with a 27-meter&nbsp;wingspan,&nbsp;is made entirely of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) &mdash; specifically, the DLR uses wound round CFRP spars and ribs made from a CFRP sandwich material.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With HAP-alpha, DLR is demonstrating its comprehensive systems expertise in the complete design, development and operation of a new and innovative aircraft, incorporating all disciplines,&rdquo;&nbsp;explains DLR executive board member for aeronautics, Markus Fischer. &ldquo;This illustrates our engagement in an important field of innovation, to strengthen Germany as a location for technology and business and to open up new perspectives for our public stakeholders in collaboration and knowledge exchange.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-dlr-haps-gvt.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-dlr-haps-gvt.jpeg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>A particular challenge of the GVT&nbsp;was the HAP-alpha&rsquo;s lightweight and therefore highly flexible design. HAP-alpha&rsquo;s wings are not yet covered for the tests, so the supporting structures are visible in this image. Source |&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/en/service/imprint\" target=\"_blank\">&copy; DLR</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The now completed GVT is an important milestone for investigating the vibration behavior of an aircraft. The goal is to identify critical vibrations that can occur during flight, takeoff and landing. This determines whether an aircraft is safe and thus airworthy. For HAP-alpha, the successful GVT marks a key step on the way to first flight tests next year, which will involve basic flight maneuvers at low altitude.</p>\n\n<p>During the GVT, numerous sensors were used to record the dynamic properties of the platform, which was fitted with electromechanical vibrators so that its vibration characteristics could be identified. A particular challenge of the GVT on HAP-alpha was its very lightweight and therefore very flexible design.</p>\n\n<p>The acquired data will now be used to update simulation models and predict flight behavior even more precisely,&nbsp;especially during maneuvers, turbulence and gusts of wind. &ldquo;This allows the project team to focus on the upcoming complete system tests, which will mark the completion of ground testing and enable subsequent flight testing,&rdquo;&nbsp;says HAP project leader Florian Nikodem from the DLR Institute of Flight Systems.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>HAP-alpha project</h3>\n\n<p>Under the leadership of the Institute of Flight Systems, the DLR aims to build comprehensive expertise for the development of high-performance, high-altitude solar-powered aircraft. HAP-alpha will also serve as a carrier platform for testing sensor systems and system technologies under realistic operating conditions in the lower stratosphere at an altitude of approximately 20 kilometers. In addition to the platform itself, DLR is developing two sensor systems for use on HAP-alpha, as well as optimized evaluation methods.</p>\n\n<p>The HAP-alpha project was launched in 2018, with the DLR pooling a wide range of expertise from the fields of aeronautics, space and security with a <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/en/latest/news/2025/uncrewed-high-flying-solar-aircraft-hap-alpha-passes-key-ground-tests\" target=\"_blank\">total of 16 participating institutes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>First test flights with the technology demonstrator&nbsp;are planned for 2025, with the first flights initially planned at low altitude at the National Test Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. Along the way, the project will pass through several review gates at which the status of the project and the feasibility of achieving the objectives will be assessed with the involvement of external experts.</p>\n\n<p>Once the aircraft has been sufficiently tested and the ground crew&rsquo;s procedures have been properly established, expansion stages of HAP-alpha will successively fly at altitudes of up to 20 kilometers. Extensive demonstration flights with the developed payload systems will then be carried out at high altitudes. In order to realize the high-altitude flights, the team is in talks with suitable flight test facilities around the world that have the necessary wide-ranging ground and air exclusion zones up to high altitudes.</p>\n</div>"

The company worked with aerospace company <a href=\"http://beta.team/\" target=\"_blank\">Beta Technologies</a> (South Burlington, Vt., U.S.) to&nbsp;achieve this landmark, conducting all testing of its propeller on Beta&rsquo;s&nbsp;electric propulsion systems (electric engines), which are designed and manufactured in-house by Beta.</p>\n\n<p>Hartzell says this milestone signifies the maturity, certifiability&nbsp;and commercialization of the AAM industry, and next-generation electric aviation. It is also a practical step forward in the industry&rsquo;s collective ability to support the growing demand for safe, low-cost, and efficient urban and regional air transport.</p>\n\n<p>With this certification, Hartzell&rsquo;s propeller is the first to earn FAA type certification specifically for integration with electric propulsion systems. These systems, like Beta&rsquo;s, are capable of managing a wide range of different loads and conditions &mdash; from regenerative braking to startup &mdash; all of which Hartzell&rsquo;s propellers are&nbsp;designed to support. The approval comes after thousands of hours of ground and flight testing over 4&nbsp;years, and verifies that the propeller exceeds the rigorous performance and safety standards of FAA Part 35.</p>\n\n<p>Hartzell&rsquo;s design is a five bladed, carbon fiber, ground-adjustable fixed-pitch propeller. Both companies have worked on the propeller development since 2021, from initial aerodynamic modeling and design to full-scale testing and validation. The result is a high-performance, low-noise propeller tailored specifically for electric engines. Beta&nbsp;will use Hartzell&rsquo;s propeller to optimize the performance and safety profile of both its Alia&nbsp;VTOL and Alia CTOL aircraft.&nbsp;The propeller is also built to serve all AAM aircraft that use&nbsp;similar electric propulsion systems.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With its decades of experience across all types of aircraft, Hartzell Propeller has understood from the beginning the unique challenges and opportunities of electric aviation,&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>says&nbsp;Kyle Clark, Founder and CEO of Beta&nbsp;Technologies. &ldquo;Their engineering precision and deep certification experience have assisted us as we bring this aircraft to market and walk through our own certification steps. We&nbsp;look forward to getting this certified propeller in the air as we continue the process of certifying our electric engines, as well as our Alia CTOL and VTOL.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Beta&nbsp;has been flying its Alia&nbsp;CTOL and VTOL aircraft with Hartzell&rsquo;s propellers for more than 4&nbsp;years &mdash;&nbsp;including completion of a&nbsp;crewed transition of an eVTOL, and several long-range flights with its fixed-wing, including a coast-to-coast trip across the U.S., and now a grand tour of Europe.</p>"

The DLR&nbsp;investigated the difference in mechanical and morphological characteristics of laminates produced on metallic and polymeric molds. First, carbon fiber-reinforced LMPAEK&nbsp;laminates for both mold types were produced and their&nbsp;tensile strength, interlaminar shear strength&nbsp;and morphological characteristics analyzed&nbsp;using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Despite differences in stiffness and thermal conductivity between the materials, the DLR found no statistically significant differences in the mechanical or crystalline properties of the laminates.</p>\n\n<p>Findings indicate that&nbsp;PA6&nbsp;in its cast form is a viable, low-cost option for nonheated AFP tooling. The DLR expects to extend this research into its 3D printing activities to open up new possibilities for efficient and flexible composites manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-477X/9/7/367\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete study here</a>.</p>"

Source | ORGANIC project</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Nature&rsquo;s solutions&nbsp;have often&nbsp;been translated to economic sectors such as<br />\narchitecture or healthcare. The&nbsp;EU-funded <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/organic-project\" target=\"_blank\">ORGANIC project</a> will go one step further: It will not only 3D print bio-inspired structures with bio-based materials, but also integrate biology, engineering and information technology to create a self-learning system. This system will evolve through technologies like AI-driven cognitive&nbsp;and and evolutionary controls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Within the project, these developments will be applied to enhancing wind turbine blades. In addition, they will have the ability to be adapted to any field in manufacturing that may benefit from bio-based materials. The 4-year project, led by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aimen.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Aimen&nbsp;Technology Centre</a>&nbsp;(O Porri&ntilde;o, Spain), started on June 1, 2025. <a href=\"https://www.iconiqinnovation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Iconiq Innovation</a>&nbsp;(Harborough, U.K.) takes&nbsp;part in this project as the work package lead for &ldquo;WP boosting bio-intelligence adoption in AM.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Additive manufacturing [AM] is highly promising but has its challenges,&rdquo; explains Andrea Fern&aacute;ndez Mart&iacute;nez, AI researcher&nbsp;in Aimen&nbsp;and project coordinator. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a young technology which needs to improve before it will yield first-time-right products. The bio-intelligent approach we take in ORGANIC is based on data and will give us the opportunity to create a system that will correct itself by comparing what has been produced with the ideal state towards a first-time-right fabrication.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The project consortium&nbsp;has 13 partners, consisting of a Spanish wind turbine manufacturer, 3D printing&nbsp;companies for large composite parts, universities and&nbsp;research and technology organizations, as well as hardware and software&nbsp;companies, an innovation consultancy and an innovation network. It spans eight European countries and multiple disciplines.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;ORGANIC&rsquo;s&nbsp;highly disciplinary is ambition: We take inspiration from nature, design&nbsp;new structures using bio-based materials, develop hardware as well as software and want the result to be adaptable across different manufacturing value chains. The use case in wind energy is our starting point.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The project team will work on wind turbine blades to validate their technological developments. Expressed simply, the blades consist of a three-layer sandwich structure. Most of its middle layer is currently made of PET, PVC or balsa wood core. By 3D printing a customized core from bio-based materials, the blades&nbsp;can be more easily recycled while keeping their intended functionality&nbsp;and technical requirements. The new approach could help save cost and increase sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In their&nbsp;first step, project partners will define the requirements of the sandwich structure&rsquo;s new core. These requirements will influence the choice of the bio-based material as well as the AI-driven generative design of the components. A prototype of the printing head will be&nbsp;equipped with sensing technology and a self-X control system. It will be tested on&nbsp;the Aimen Laser Applications Centre&rsquo;s AM pilot line. Analyzing the results will determine which sensors will be needed in the hardware&rsquo;s second iteration.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this work, the software part of the project will aim to develop an AI-drive cognitive and evolutionary&nbsp;control system based on digital twins, leveraging a reinforcement learning framework. Asset Administration Shell (AAS)-based digital twins will be integrated for standardization and interoperability via an ontology-based knowledge system.</p>\n\n<p><em>One of the five projects in the scope of bio-intelligent manufacturing, this project has received funding from HORIZON-CL4-2024-TWIN-TRANSITION-01-TWO-STAGE under grant agreement number 101178127. Funded by the European Union.</em></p>"

The facility will be in addition to its current location at 1964 Byers Road in the same area, with majority of the investment going toward&nbsp;machinery and equipment that will be used to manufacture aerospace parts for&nbsp;critical defense and commercial systems.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past 5&nbsp;years, Spintech has evolved significantly, driven by customers&rsquo;&nbsp;demand for high-quality structural airframe components at lower costs and higher production rates. Historically, Spintech operated as a tooling provider through its Smart Tooling division, which offers&nbsp;solutions for aerospace composite (carbon fiber) manufacturing. Since its commercial launch in 2010, Smart Tooling has successfully been deployed on more than 50 flight-qualified aerospace systems, including high-profile platforms such as SpaceX&rsquo;s <em>Falcon 9</em>, Boeing&rsquo;s ecoDemonstrator, General Atomics&rsquo; <em>SkyGuardian</em>&nbsp;and Bell/Boeing&rsquo;s V-22. However, as Smart Tooling products are reusable for up to 100 cycles, they generate&nbsp;limited sales volume, constraining revenue growth. To seek other growth opportunities Spintech started to explore other means to apply its composite processing knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Defense&rsquo;s (DOD&rsquo;s) pivot toward&nbsp;low-cost unmanned systems was what initially enabled Spintech to extend its work beyond tooling, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/spintech-opens-new-composites-manufacturing-division-hawthorn-composites\" target=\"_blank\">the launch of Hawthorn Composites in 2021</a> to meet this demand. To this day, Hawthorn Composites delivers structural composite airframes and airframe components for unmanned aircraft, with capabilities that enable it to produce tens of complex airframe components &mdash; such as fuselages, wings, tails&nbsp;and nosecones &mdash; per day, positioning Spintech as a key supplier to DOD prime contractors and the DOD itself.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last few years, Hawthorn has secured major contracts for six key unmanned aircraft system (UAS) platforms in both the defense and commercial space, progressing from engineering concepts through low-rate initial production (LRIP)&nbsp;and transitioning to high-rate production. The U.S. DOD&rsquo;s current endeavors &mdash; ordering UAS for missions like intelligence, surveillance&nbsp;and reconnaissance (ISR), counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS)&nbsp;and low-cost munitions &mdash; is further fueling Hawthorn&rsquo;s growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Spintech&rsquo;s newest leasing, bringing its total operational space to 90,000 square feet, will&nbsp;produce up to 533 airframes per month and host a Systems Integration&nbsp;Lab (SIL) in a controlled unclassified information (CUI) environment. The SIL will enable the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and third-party partners to integrate new payloads and flight controls onto Group II and Group III UAS (small- to medium-sized drones). The SIL will house vehicles that adhere to modular open systems architecture (MOSA) and weapons open systems architecture (WOSA) standards. This compliance supports rapid deployment of new capabilities, similar to an App store-like model, reducing time to field.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, Spintech anticipates adding a 60,000-square-foot&nbsp;facility and a 100,000-square-foot&nbsp;facility within 2 years to support other U.S. DOD program ramp-ups. If successful in transitioning engineered platforms to production, Spintech&rsquo;s Dayton-area footprint could reach 250,000 square feet&nbsp;by the end of 2027.</p>\n\n<p>What other growth projects is Spintech considering?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Through its Hawthorn Composites division, Spintech is exploring strategic opportunities to drive growth over the next 12 months. Its team is&nbsp;pursuing additional composite airframe manufacturing contracts with defense and commercial UAS customers to expand its&nbsp;market presence. Spintech is also&nbsp;developing value-added services, such as enhanced manufacturing processes and integration solutions, to deliver greater value to existing customers.&nbsp;</p>"
