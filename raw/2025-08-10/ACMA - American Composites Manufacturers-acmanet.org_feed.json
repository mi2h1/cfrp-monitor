        "value": "<p>With past successes at the Lounavoima (Finland) energy plant, QHeat was called on to help improve energy efficiency, specifically in the geothermal wells. In partnership with Exel Composites, the companies created and installed custom-made composite collector pipes that improved borehole energy efficiency by 10%. The pipes also meet the plant’s focus on durability, sustainability, and recyclability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collector pipes are installed two kilometers underground, so they must be able to withstand their own weight as well as provide insulation to minimize heat loss during energy transfer. Traditional materials were ruled out as metal conducts heat and plastic does not have the necessary mechanical strength required at the depths of this project. Exel designed and manufactured the metal-free pipes using fiberglass in a pultrusion process, optimizing the material for insulation and flow. QHeat installed the pipes using specialized tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our core expertise is in understanding what composites can enable. While they offer general benefits like durability and lightness, we focus on identifying what’s required in each unique case and solving those needs with the right combination,” says Tiina Uotila, Technical Sales Manager at Exel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We got to work ambitiously and openly on a product that has the potential to launch us into new business areas and markets. We could demonstrate that the composite pipes have an estimated 50-year lifecycle and can be responsibly disposed of at the end of it,” said Pertti Kainu, Product Business Owner at Exel Composites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think we all take our hats off to QHeat for developing their technology and a functional system, as well as having excellent references and diverse expertise. It’s not self-evident to be able to drill two kilometers into the bedrock,” Kainu added.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/qheat-and-exel-composites-improve-efficiency-in-energy-plant-with-composite-collector-pipes/\">QHeat and Exel Composites Improve Efficiency in Energy Plant with Composite Collector Pipes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

Skyfly’s Chief Technical Officer, Dr. William Brooks, piloted the flight of the Vertically-Capable Aircraft (VCA) from Turweston Aerodrome in Northamptonshire to Bicester Airfield in Oxfordshire, and back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test program of the Axe has been focused on validation of the craft’s airframe and control systems in wing-borne flight. The latest test demonstrated the VCA’s capability to take off and land vertically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way some aerodynamic features of the canard wing have been fine-tuned, but the fundamental original design of the aircraft has met and exceeded expectations throughout the testing phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes the Axe special is its ability to operate as a traditional airplane in forward flight. The Axe can take off vertically and the design of the main wing and a canard wing allow normal forward flying operation in flight. The wings improve the range of the aircraft as well. Mechanical control links to control surfaces do not rely on any electrical system, enabling the ability to glide and land in the event of system failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweighting was a focus of the design team and was achieved – the Axe weighs just 750 kg thanks to the use of carbon fiber composite materials throughout the entire structure of the aircraft. The Axe also reduced weight and cut operating costs by eliminating rotating engines and wings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Skyfly earned permission from the UK Civil Aviation Authority to move forward with conventional fixed-wing flying, then to conduct airborne transitions between vertical and wing-borne flight. With this step behind them, the Skyfly team is moving into testing the full transition phase. The next Axe prototype will feature two electric motors on each of the four wingtips. Each motor will be encased in a single nacelle and will be powered by swapable and removable lithium batteries housed in the fuselage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Brooks commented, “The aircraft performed very well. It has a gentle feel in turbulence, giving the impression of more span because of the motor masses at the tips. The comfort, outstanding view and lack of noise make for enjoyable flying.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Skyfly plans for the first deliveries of the Axe in 2026.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/skyfly-completes-europes-first-evtol-flight-between-airfields/\">Skyfly Completes Europe’s First eVTOL Flight Between Airfields</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

The new 36 Molokai, available in October 2025, is the next generation of fishing vessels, built for those who want comfort while they fish for the big catch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 36 Molokai is based on Aquila’s highly successful 47 Molokai. 47 Molokai was designed in partnership with Peart Yacht Design and provides luxury catamaran comfort with durability and offshore fishing capabilities. Molokai 36 is also being developed in collaboration with Pearl with a focus on an efficient hull, a strategically designed deck layout, and the strength and structure to withstand the challenges posed by the sea and by big fish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of particular interest is the 36 Molokai&#8217;s carbon fiber hardtop. Hardtops have traditionally been built of fiberglass which may require additional reinforcement. The new carbon fiber hardtop is rigid and strong,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>allowing stress to be distributed evenly across the structure. Even with the installation of heavy towers with antennas, outriggers, and electronics, the hardtop, built of advanced composite materials, stays strong and durable without added structural reinforcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catamaran is also designed for comfort with 3 bow sun loungers, optional storage features, a summer kitchen, an integrated tackle station, a sleeping cabin, and a private head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t set out to build just another 36-foot boat,&#8221; said Jean Raas, CEO of Aquila USA and Chief Product Officer. &#8220;We built a fishing weapon that happens to be 36 feet long. Every design decision was made with serious anglers in mind. The beautiful thing is it&#8217;s also a great boat for entertaining family and friends.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/aquila-catamaran-built-with-carbon-fiber-for-hardcore-fishing/\">Aquila Catamaran Built with Carbon Fiber for Hardcore Fishing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Wind energy is celebrated for its sustainability and effectiveness, but there are concerns about recycling wind blades and about the space required for wind turbines and wind farms, especially in urban areas. Researchers from the University of Glasgow’s James Watt School of Engineering used computer simulations to explore how Bladeless Wind Turbines (BWTs) could be built for maximum efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BWTs consist of a cylinder built of resin-reinforced carbon fiber or glass fiber that is anchored to the ground by a rod. Traditional wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of the moving blades into electricity. In comparison, BWTs generate power by vortex-induced vibration – a process where the cylinder oscillates when the wind hits it and the movement of the cylinder generates mechanical energy that is then transformed into electric energy by a generator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team at the University of Glasgow discovered an optimal design for BWTs where power generation is maximized against structural strength. After assessing a variety of structures, the engineers determined the ideal BWT consisted of an 80cm mast which is 65cm in diameter. To date, prototypes delivered a maximum of 100 watts of power and the simulation of the ideal BWT delivered a maximum of 460 watts of power. Once scaled up to utility grade systems, the BWTs could generate 1 kilowatt or more, making them a practical alternative for renewable energy systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Wrik Mallik, Lecturer in Aerospace Engineering at the university and researcher on the project, said, “What this study shows for the first time is that, counterintuitively, the structure with the highest efficiency for extracting energy is not in fact the structure which gives the highest power output. Instead, we have identified the ideal midpoint between the design variables to maximize the ability of BWTs to generate power while maintaining their structural strength.”<br />&nbsp;<br />The James Watt School of Engineering’s Professor Sondipon Adhikari, another researcher on the project, added, “We hope that this research will help spur industry to develop new prototypes of BWT designs by clearly demonstrating the most efficient design. Removing some of the guesswork involved in refining prototypes could help bring BWTs closer to becoming a more useful part of the world’s toolbox for achieving net-zero through renewables.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/bladeless-wind-turbines-offer-potential-for-efficient-renewable-energy-production/\">Bladeless Wind Turbines Offer Potential for Efficient, Renewable Energy Production</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

        "value": "<p>Sujin Lee, a National Research Council postdoctoral fellow, was curious to understand why a mantis shrimp’s appendage did not break when it smashed the shells of other creatures with the force of a .22 caliber bullet. Lee joined NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) materials research engineer Edwin Chan to discover how this is possible. The result of the research led to the development of an advanced material based on the Bouligand structures of the exoskeleton of these amazing creatures that is tough enough to withstand challenging aerospace applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers synthesized the structures from cellulose nanocrystals found in plant fibers and the nanocrystals assembled into plates and layered on top of each other forming synthetic Bouligand structures. Using high-frequency sound waves, the researchers modified the crystals then formed them into thin films.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The films were tested using high-intensity lasers to fire microprojectiles made of silica. The microprojectiles can leave indentations but can also bounce back depending on how the energy spreads in shockwaves after impact. By making the nanocrystals thicker, the films redirected the shockwaves from the impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chan explained, “The results and insights of this research mark an important advance in bioinspired materials design with applications for aerospace, such as helping spacecraft survive the impact of micrometeoroids and protecting orbiting satellites that collide with debris.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team sees future uses of the bioinspired material in applications such as blast-resistant building materials, bullet-resistant glass, protective helmets, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These findings suggest that there are different ways to design materials to absorb impact, and we can use this knowledge to create more resilient and longer-lasting materials,” said Chan. “If you’re a boxer in the ring, you want to fight nine rounds, not just one.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/nist-researchers-develop-advanced-material-based-on-exoskeleton-of-mantis-shrimp/\">NIST Researchers Develop Advanced Material Based on Exoskeleton of Mantis Shrimp</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"

The event marked a significant milestone, breaking ACMA’s previous attendance record and underscoring the growing momentum behind composites policy engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the event, attendees participated in more than 80 Congressional meetings with lawmakers and staff from both the House and Senate, effectively elevating the voice of the composites industry. In addition to these impactful Hill meetings, the Fly-In provided valuable networking opportunities for participants to build relationships with peers and ACMA staff who share a strong commitment to advancing the industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants met with dozens of Congressional and Senate offices on several important topics for the industry, including:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Promoting continued innovation and expansion of the industry through sound tax policy </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Supporting a science-based process for evaluating styrene  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Explaining the impact of tariffs and supply chain uncertainty on the ability to manufacture advanced materials in the United States </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s Fly-In featured a standout lineup of expert speakers and federal officials who shared their knowledge on critical issues including tax policy and the economy. Attendees gained valuable insight from high-level briefings, including a session with Nancy Beck, Ph.D., DABT, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who explained the agency’s current approach to chemical regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The event also included remarks from U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), a long-time champion of composites and their role in advancing clean energy, infrastructure, and domestic manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another agenda highlight was the launch of ACMA’s “Smart Policy, Smarter Materials” campaign, an advocacy initiative aimed at preventing misguided regulation that could harm American manufacturing and innovation. The campaign emphasizes the essential role styrene-based composites play in transportation, infrastructure, and clean energy, while calling for regulatory decisions grounded in sound science and smart policy.

        "value": "<p>As part of the FCVGen2.0 project, led by Ford Motor Company and funded in part by the Advanced Propulsion Centre UK (APC), Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech have partnered to reclaim high-value continuous carbon fiber from hydrogen tanks at the end-of-life for reuse in new applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cygnet Texkimp’s technology recovers carbon fiber from a nano-infused, resin-based material system developed by Viritech. Viritech’s graphene nanomaterial is processed at Cygnet Texkimp’s Innovation Centre using the DEECOM composites recycling solution, applying pressure and superheated steam to separate the fibers from the polymer matrix. The reclaimed fibers are unwound and rewound onto bobbins to be readied for reuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally recycled carbon fiber is processed as short fibers and limited to use for sheet molding compound, extrusion, or fiber reinforced plastics. The recovery and unwinding of continuous fibers allows the recycled fibers to be used in place of virgin fibers in pultrusion, weaving, towpreg, filament winding, and other applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr Yan Liu, senior research and development specialist at Cygnet Texkimp and project leader said, “Our partnership with Viritech demonstrates the potential for hydrogen tanks to be recycled at a meaningful rate. This is significant because it supports the automotive industry’s work to achieve true circularity in the manufacture of filament-wound parts by recovering fibers in a way that’s convenient for their reuse and maximizes their potential ongoing value.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aislinn Kiely, project delivery lead at APC, added, “The capabilities that Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech have developed while working on the FCVGen2.0 project highlight the mutual benefits that can be unlocked by undertaking collaborative research &amp; development activities. Cygnet Texkimp’s recovery and recycling process, coupled with Viritech’s material development, offer a significant opportunity to support the transition to zero-emission vehicles and establish a zero-emission vehicle manufacturing supply chain in the UK.” Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech are continuing the partnership to extend the development of filament winding technology for sustainable, efficient manufacturing for hydrogen pressure vessels.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://acmanet.org/cygnet-texkimp-and-viritech-recovering-continuous-carbon-fibers-from-h2-tanks-for-ford-project/\">Cygnet Texkimp and Viritech Recovering Continuous Carbon Fibers from H2 Tanks for Ford Project</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://acmanet.org\">American Composites Manufacturers Association</a>.</p>"
