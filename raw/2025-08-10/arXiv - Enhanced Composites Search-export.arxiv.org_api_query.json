    "summary": "False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be\neffectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments\nconducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in\nenhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small\npedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.",

    "summary": "Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for\nStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their\nintegration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted\nto enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.",

Characterizations by SEM and TEM\nmicroscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and\ndynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology\nand structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to\nexplain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects\nthose properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the\npolymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer\nchains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant\nstructures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe\nthe conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general\neffective media theory was introduced. The analysis revealed that, at low\nreactant concentrations, the NP increase the conductivity of the adjacent PEDOT\nby over two orders of magnitude.",

We use a vane geometry\nto study the rheology of a dry granular material mixed with flexible fibers\nwith different volume fractions and properties. The vane is immersed in the\nmaterial, and the granular pressure increases with the depth of immersion. When\nthe vane begins rotating, we observe a transient regime, which depends on the\nnumber of blades and is associated with the mobilization of material between\nthe blades. Following this transient phase, a stationary regime is reached. By\nmeasuring and modeling the stationary flow that develops around the vane, we\ndeduce the effective friction coefficient of the material from the torque\nmeasured on the vane. Following this approach, we investigate the effect of the\nfiber volume fraction and the aspect ratio on the effective friction\ncoefficient of the grain-fiber mixture.

This gives one inhomogeneous universal deformation\nfamily: the non-isochoric Family Z1 of combined bending and stretching\ndeformations. In addition, Family 0Z consists of homogeneous deformations that\nrespect the inextensibility constraint. We further show that if all principal\ninvariants are constant and deformed fibers remain straight, then only\nhomogeneous universal deformations are possible.

    "summary": "Composite materials are used across engineering applications for their\nsuperior mechanical performance, a result of efficient load transfer between\nthe structure and matrix phases. However, the inherently two-dimensional\nstructure of laminated composites reduces their robustness to shear and\nout-of-plane loads, while unpredictable interlaminar failure and fiber pull-out\ncan cause a catastrophic loss of load capacity. Meanwhile, advances toward\nuncovering structure-property relations in architected materials have led to\nhighly tunable mechanical properties, deformation, and even failure. Some of\nthese architected materials have reached near-theoretical limits; however, the\nmajority of current work focuses on describing the response of a\nsingle-material network in air, and the effect of adding a load-bearing second\nphase to a three-dimensional architecture is not well understood. Here, we\ndevelop facile fabrication methods for realizing centimeter-scale polymer- and\ncarbon-based architected interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) materials,\ni.e., two-phase materials consisting of a continuous 3D architecture surrounded\nby a load-bearing matrix across length scales, and determine the effect of\ngeometry and constituent material properties on the mechanics of these\narchitected IPCs. Using these experiments together with computational models,\nwe show that the matrix phase distributes stress effectively, resulting in a\nhigh-strength, stable response. Notably, failure delocalization enhances energy\ndissipation of the composite, achieving specific energy absorption (SEA) values\ncomparable to those of wound fiber tubes. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nstress state in an IPC can be tuned using geometric design and introduce an\nexample in an architected composite. Altogether, this work bridges the gap\nbetween mechanically efficient composites and tunable architected materials.",

However, the inherently two-dimensional\nstructure of laminated composites reduces their robustness to shear and\nout-of-plane loads, while unpredictable interlaminar failure and fiber pull-out\ncan cause a catastrophic loss of load capacity. Meanwhile, advances toward\nuncovering structure-property relations in architected materials have led to\nhighly tunable mechanical properties, deformation, and even failure. Some of\nthese architected materials have reached near-theoretical limits; however, the\nmajority of current work focuses on describing the response of a\nsingle-material network in air, and the effect of adding a load-bearing second\nphase to a three-dimensional architecture is not well understood. Here, we\ndevelop facile fabrication methods for realizing centimeter-scale polymer- and\ncarbon-based architected interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) materials,\ni.e., two-phase materials consisting of a continuous 3D architecture surrounded\nby a load-bearing matrix across length scales, and determine the effect of\ngeometry and constituent material properties on the mechanics of these\narchitected IPCs. Using these experiments together with computational models,\nwe show that the matrix phase distributes stress effectively, resulting in a\nhigh-strength, stable response. Notably, failure delocalization enhances energy\ndissipation of the composite, achieving specific energy absorption (SEA) values\ncomparable to those of wound fiber tubes. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nstress state in an IPC can be tuned using geometric design and introduce an\nexample in an architected composite. Altogether, this work bridges the gap\nbetween mechanically efficient composites and tunable architected materials."

The\nhigh-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in\nthe limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the\npermeability on the ratio $d/D$. It was shown, in particular, that in the limit\n$d/D\\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite\nsimilar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization\noscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous.",
