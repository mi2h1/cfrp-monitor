    "summary": "Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying\ntemperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and\nreliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment\napplications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage\nmechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at\nambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix\ndebonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading\nresidual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of\nsubsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology,\ninterface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization\nand life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a\nnewly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography\n(FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures\nwith depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography.\nHowever, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and\nlateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of\ndamage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer\nlearning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network\n(IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based\non limited thermographic datasets.",

Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method\nenhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by\nenabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model\nretraining.

It is noted that the\nimprovement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer\nreactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for\nimproving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of\nresearch, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and\nthe technological characteristics of the liquid polymer binder, aimed at\nincreasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The\neffectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites\nin the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The\npeculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy\npolymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on\nthe effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for\ndeagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium\nduring the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the\nimprovement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified\nby ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well\nas the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy\nmatrices. Some issues of biological modifications of components of polymers for\nfunctional application are briefly reviewed.",
