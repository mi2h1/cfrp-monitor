They, however, suffer from a relatively poor out-of plane performance. Improving this requires a thorough understanding of their behavior to out-of-plane loadings such as impact. Their impact response is very complex in nature due to their strain-rate dependent properties, progressive damage during impact, and their many failure modes such as delamination, fiber or matrix failure, and fiber crush. In this work, response of plain woven CFRP laminates are studied via experiments and numerical simulations using the finite element package LS-DYNA. Quasi-static and dynamic tests were conducted to provide the materials parameters for the material model; MAT162. Once the simulations were validated, the response of the CFRP to impact was investigated in terms of different material properties, energy absorption, and damage modes. Based on these results strategies are suggested to improve the behavior of CFRPs under impact loadings.",

Since iron is the most used metal in the world, reinforcing iron with graphene can reduce the overall requirement of material in any application where strength is demanded. However, the effect of graphene reinforcement on the mechanical properties of iron needs to be known before the industrial application of the composite. In this paper, we have investigated the mechanical properties of graphene-reinforced iron composite by Molecular Dynamics (MD) method for various conditions. The properties were investigated by applying uniaxial tension on a modeled representative volume element (RVE). The effect of temperature on the mechanical property of the composite was also studied because the knowledge is required for manufacturing products with the composite operating at a wide temperature range. MD analysis also revealed that the initiation of fracture is from the matrix-fiber interface. We also investigated how the distance of vacancy defects from the matrix-fiber interface affects the mechanical properties of the composite, which can be used to select a suitable manufacturing process. The results obtained from this study show that vacancy defects lower the strength at a greater extent as it gets closer to the interface.",

Micro-hardness measurements from indentation reveal a significant increase with decreasing indenter size.

Typically, SFRC structures are manufactured by injection molding, which induces heterogeneous microstructures, and the resulting nonlinear anisotropic behaviors are challenging to predict by conventional micromechanical analyses.

DMN is a physics-embedded machine learning model that learns the microscale material morphologies hidden in representative volume elements of composites through offline training. By coupling DMN with finite elements, we have developed a highly accurate and efficient data-driven approach, which predicts nonlinear behaviors of composite materials and structures at a computational speed orders-of-magnitude faster than the high-fidelity direct numerical simulation. To model industrial-scale SFRC products, transfer learning is utilized to generate a unified DMN database, which effectively captures the effects of injection molding-induced fiber orientations and volume fractions on the overall composite properties. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the promising performance of this LS-DYNA machine learning-based multiscale method for SFRC modeling.",

    "summary": "We present a Bayesian methodology to infer the elastic modulus of the constituent polymer and the fiber orientation state in a short-fiber reinforced polymer composite (SFRP). The properties are inversely determined using only a few experimental tests. Developing composite manufacturing digital twins for SFRP composite processes, including injection molding and extrusion deposition additive manufacturing (EDAM) requires extensive experimental material characterization. In particular, characterizing the composite mechanical properties is time consuming and therefore, micromechanics models are used to fully identify the elasticity tensor. Hence, the objective of this paper is to infer the fiber orientation and the effective polymer modulus and therefore, identify the elasticity tensor of the composite with minimal experimental tests. To that end, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model coupled with a micromechanics model to infer the fiber orientation and the polymer elastic modulus simultaneously which we then use to estimate the composite elasticity tensor. We motivate and demonstrate the methodology for the EDAM process but the development is such that it is applicable to other SFRP composites processed via other methods. Our results demonstrate that the approach provides a reliable framework for the inference, with as few as three tensile tests, while accounting for epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. Posterior predictive checks show that the model is able to recreate the experimental data well. The ability of the Bayesian approach to calibrate the material properties and its associated uncertainties, make it a promising tool for enabling a probabilistic predictive framework for composites manufacturing digital twins.",

    "summary": "Computational stress analysis is an important step in the design of material systems. Finite element method (FEM) is a standard approach of performing stress analysis of complex material systems. A way to accelerate stress analysis is to replace FEM with a data-driven machine learning based stress analysis approach. In this study, we consider a fiber-reinforced matrix composite material system and we use deep learning tools to find an alternative to the FEM approach for stress field prediction. We first try to predict stress field maps for composite material systems of fixed number of fibers with varying spatial configurations. Specifically, we try to find a mapping between the spatial arrangement of the fibers in the composite material and the corresponding von Mises stress field. This is achieved by using a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture, using true stress maps of systems with same number of fibers as training data. U-Net is a encoder-decoder network which in this study takes in the composite material image as an input and outputs the stress field image which is of the same size as the input image. We perform a robustness analysis by taking different initializations of the training samples to find the sensitivity of the prediction accuracy to the small number of training samples. When the number of fibers in the composite material system is increased for the same volume fraction, a finer finite element mesh discretization is required to represent the geometry accurately. This leads to an increase in the computational cost. Thus, the secondary goal here is to predict the stress field for systems with larger number of fibers with varying spatial configurations using information from the true stress maps of relatively cheaper systems of smaller fiber number.",

    "summary": "Wood is one of the main materials used for making musical instruments due to its outstanding acoustical properties. Despite such unique properties, its inferior mechanical properties, moisture sensitivity, and time- and cost-consuming procedure for making instruments in comparison with other materials (e.g., composites) are always considered as its disadvantages in making musical instruments. In this study, the acoustic parameters of three different polyester composites separately reinforced by carbon fiber, glass fiber, and hemp fiber are investigated and are also compared with those obtained for three different types of wood specimens called poplar, walnut, and beech wood, which have been extensively used in making Iranian traditional musical instruments. The acoustical properties such as acoustic coefficient, sound quality factor, and acoustic conversion factor were examined using some non-destructive tests based on longitudinal and flexural free vibration and also forced vibration methods. Furthermore, the water absorption of these polymeric composites was compared with that of the wood samples.

      "value": "Wood is one of the main materials used for making musical instruments due to its outstanding acoustical properties. Despite such unique properties, its inferior mechanical properties, moisture sensitivity, and time- and cost-consuming procedure for making instruments in comparison with other materials (e.g., composites) are always considered as its disadvantages in making musical instruments. In this study, the acoustic parameters of three different polyester composites separately reinforced by carbon fiber, glass fiber, and hemp fiber are investigated and are also compared with those obtained for three different types of wood specimens called poplar, walnut, and beech wood, which have been extensively used in making Iranian traditional musical instruments.

The global method we focus on, is called 'stochastic homogenization'. In this approach, the classical deterministic homogenization techniques and procedures are used to compute the macroscopic parameters of a composite starting from its microscopic properties. The stochastic part is due to averaging over some series of samples, and the fact that these samples fit into the concept of RVE (Representative Volume Element) in order to reduce the variance effect.\n  In this article, we present a novel method for computation of effective electric properties of composites -- it is based on the analysis of the connectivity graph (and the respective adjacency matrix) for each sample of a composite material. We describe how this matrix is constructed in order to take into account complex microscopic geometry. We also explain what we mean by homogenization procedure for electrical conductivity, and how the constructed matrix is related to the problem. The developed method is applied to a test study of the influence of micromorphology of composites materials on their conductivity.",

The experimental findings were utilized as input data for numerical analysis to examine the impact of fiber morphology and volume fraction in thermal transport phenomena. Our results revealed that composites incorporating non-circular fibers manifested higher thermal conductivity than traditional circular fibers in the transverse direction.

    "summary": "Fiber reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) materials are extensively used in lightweight applications due to their high specific strength and other favorable properties including enhanced endurance and corrosion resistance. However, these materials are inevitably exposed to moisture, which is known to drastically reduce their mechanical properties caused by moisture absorption and often accompanied with plasticization, weight gain, hygrothermal swelling, and de-bonding between fiber and matrix. Hence, it is vital to understand moisture diffusion mechanics into FRPCs. The presence of fibers, especially impermeable like Carbon fibers, introduce tortuous moisture diffusion pathways through polymer matrix. In this paper, we elucidate the impact of fiber packing and morphology on moisture diffusion in FRPC materials. Computational models are developed within a finite element framework to evaluate moisture kinetics in impermeable FRPCs. We introduce a tortuosity factor for measuring the extent of deviation in moisture diffusion pathways due to impermeable fiber reinforcements. Two-dimensional micromechanical models are analyzed with varying fiber volume fractions, spatial distributions and morphology to elucidate the influence of internal micromechanical fiber architectures on tortuous diffusion pathways and corresponding diffusivities. Finally, a relationship between tortuosity and diffusivity is established such that diffusivity can be calculated using tortuosity for a given micro-architecture. Tortuosity can be easily calculated for a given architecture by solving steady state diffusion governing equations, whereas time-dependent transient diffusion equations need to be solved for calculating moisture diffusivity. Hence, tortuosity, instead of diffusivity, can be used in future composites designs, multi-scale analyses, and optimization for enabling robust structures in moisture environments.",

The distinctive feature of construction of nano-reinforced composite is such that the microscale carbon fibers are packed in hexagonal array in the carbon nanotube reinforced polymer matrix (CNRP). We considered three different cases of CNRP, in which carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are: (i) aligned along the direction of carbon fiber, (ii) aligned radially to the axis of carbon fiber, and (iii) randomly dispersed. Accordingly, multiscale models were developed. First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and then Mori-Tanaka technique were used to estimate the effective elastic properties of CNRP. Second, a micromechanical three-phase shear lag model was developed considering the staggering effect of microscale fibers and the application of radial loads on the cylindrical representative volume element (RVE) of nano-reinforced composite. Our results reveal that the stress transfer characteristics of the nano-reinforced composite are significantly improved by controlling the CNT morphology, particularly, when they are randomly dispersed around the microscale fiber. The results from the developed shear lag model were also validated with the finite element shear lag simulations and found to be in good agreement.",

Fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 4D printing, in particular, uses thermoplastics to produce artifacts and requires computational analysis to assist the design processes of complex geometries. However, these artifacts are weak against structural loads, and the design quality can be limited by less accurate material models and numerical simulations. To address these issues, this paper propounds a composite structure design made of two materials - polylactic acid (PLA) and carbon fiber reinforced PLA (CFPLA) - to increase the structural strength of 4D printed artifacts and a workflow composed of several physical experiments and series of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to characterize materials. We apply this workflow to 3D printed samples fabricated with different printed parameters to accurately characterize the materials and implement a sequential finite element analysis (FEA) to achieve accurate simulations. The accuracy of deformation induced by the triggering process is both computationally and experimentally verified with several creative design examples, and the 95% confidence interval of the accuracy is (0.972, 0.985). We believe the presented workflow is essential to the combination of geometry, material mechanism and design, and has various potential applications.",

Among single and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), the latter is preferred by manufacturers and engineers for making composites due to their economic feasibility of synthesizing.

In this article, we developed a novel theoretical approach for predicting the variation of strength and stiffness of MWCNT reinforced iron composites (MWCNT-Fe) with the layer number of reinforcing MWCNT and validated the prediction with a series of Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our analysis revealed that for every addition of two extra layers, the strength and stiffness of the composite increase 9.8% and 7.2% respectively up to eight layered MWCNT and then becomes saturated. We also employed MD simulations for investigating the effect of grain boundary on the failure mechanism of CNT reinforced iron composites in contrast to previous studies. Our investigations revealed that instead of the matrix-fiber interface, the failure was initiated from the grain boundary and merges with the interface. The results in this study will not only help engineers and manufacturers choose optimal layered MWCNT for synthesizing composite for a specific application but also provide scientists a new method to model composites for predicting desired properties.",

    "summary": "This paper aims to understand the role of directional material properties on the mechanical responses of origami structures. We consider the Miura-Ori structures our target model due to their collapsibility and negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effects, which are widely used in shock absorbers, disaster shelters, aerospace applications, etc. Traditional Miura-Ori structures are made of isotropic materials (Aluminum, Acrylic), whose mechanical properties like stiffness and NPR are well understood. However, how these responses are affected by directional materials, like Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites, lacks in-depth understanding. To that end, we study how fiber directions and arrangements in CFRP composites and Miura-Ori's geometric parameters control the stiffness and NPR of such structures. Through finite element analysis, we show that Miura-Ori structures made of CFRP composites can achieve higher stiffness and Poisson's ratio values than those made of an isotropic material like Aluminum. Then through regression analysis, we establish the relationship between different geometric parameters and the corresponding mechanical responses, which is further utilized to discover the Miura-Ori structure's optimal shape. We also show that the shear modulus is a dominant parameter that controls the mechanical responses mentioned above among the individual composite material properties within the Miura-Ori structure. We demonstrate that we can optimize the Miura-Ori structure by finding geometric and material parameters that result in combined stiffest and most compressible structures. We anticipate our research to be a starting point for designing and optimizing more sophisticated origami structures with composite materials incorporated.",

    "summary": "Designing fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) with a tailored nonlinear stress-strain response can enable innovative applications across various industries. Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of FRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop PC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of FRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves for training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually appealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are collision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints during generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality designs with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the physical constraints.

      "value": "Designing fiber-reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) with a tailored nonlinear stress-strain response can enable innovative applications across various industries. Currently, no efforts have achieved the inverse design of FRPCs that target the entire stress-strain curve. Here, we develop PC3D_Diffusion, a 3D spatial diffusion model designed for the inverse design of FRPCs. We generate 1.35 million FRPCs and calculate their stress-strain curves for training. Although the vanilla PC3D_Diffusion can generate visually appealing results, less than 10% of FRPCs generated by the vanilla model are collision-free, in which fibers do not intersect with each other. We then propose a loss-guided, learning-free approach to apply physical constraints during generation. As a result, PC3D_Diffusion can generate high-quality designs with tailored mechanical behaviors while guaranteeing to satisfy the physical constraints. PC3D_Diffusion advances FRPC inverse design and may facilitate the inverse design of other 3D materials, offering potential applications in industries reliant on materials with custom mechanical properties."

    "summary": "This study is focused on the mechanical properties and stress transfer behavior of multiscale composites containing nano- and micro-scale reinforcements. The distinctive feature of construction of this composite is such that the carbon nanostructures (CNS) are dispersed in the matrix around the continuous microscale fiber to modify microfiber-matrix interfacial adhesion. Such CNS are considered to be made of aligned CNTs (A-CNTs). Accordingly, multiscale models are developed for such hybrid composites. First, molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Mori-Tanaka method are used to determine the effective elastic properties of nano-engineered interphase layer composed of CNS and epoxy. Subsequently, a micromechanical pull-out model for a continuous fiber multi-scale composite is developed, and stress transfer behavior is studied for different orientations of CNS considering their perfect and imperfect interfacial bonding conditions with the surrounding epoxy. Such interface condition was modeled using the linear spring layer model with a continuous traction but a displacement jump. The current pull-out model accounts for the radial as well as the axial deformations of different orthotropic constituent phases of the multiscale composite. The results from the developed pull-out model are compared with those of the finite element analyses and are found to be in good agreement. Our results reveal that the stress transfer characteristics of the multiscale composite are significantly improved by controlling the CNT morphology around the fiber, particularly, when they are aligned along the axial direction of the microscale fiber. The results also show that the CNS-epoxy interface weakening significantly influences the radial stress along the length of the microscale fiber.",

    "summary": "Carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced metal matrix composites (MMCs) are gaining the attention of the researchers because of their demand in space and automobile industries for having low weight and high mechanical properties. Iron is the most used metal in all engineering fields. Therefore, reinforcing iron with CNT can reduce its required amount, which might have a positive economic impact due to the reduced cost of production. However, before the industrial application of any material the mechanical properties under different conditions must be known. In this study, the mechanical properties of iron reinforced separately with single, double and triple wall CNTs are investigated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The study revealed that the strength and stiffness of pure iron could be enhanced up to 80.4 % and 57.4 %, respectively, by adding CNTs into iron. We also investigated the effect of fiber volume percentage and temperature on the mechanical properties of the composite having single, double and triplewalled carbon nanotubes individually. As the stone-wales and bi-vacancy defects are inherently introduced in CNTs during manufacturing, their effect on mechanical properties are also investigated in the present study",

Key to its design is inexpensive materials assembled from traditionally available fabrication machines to support the rapid exploration of applications from computational composites. The actuation layer is a soft magnetic sheet that is programmed to either bond, repel, or remain agnostic to other areas of the sheet. The computation layer is a flexible PCB made from copper-clad kapton engraved by a fiber laser, powered by a third energy-storage layer comprised of 0.4mm-thin lithium polymer batteries. We present the material layup and an accompanying digital fabrication process enabling users to rapidly prototype their own untethered, interactive and tangible prototypes. The material is low-profile, inexpensive, and fully untethered, capable of being used for a variety of applications in HCI and robotics including structural origami and proprioception.",

Current approaches in density-based TO for FRC use the underlying finite element mesh both for analysis and design representation. This poses several limitations while enforcing sub-element fiber spacing and generating high-resolution continuous fibers. In contrast, we propose a mesh-independent representation based on a neural network (NN) both to capture the matrix topology and fiber distribution. The implicit NN-based representation enables geometric and material queries at a higher resolution than a mesh discretization. This leads to the accurate extraction of functionally-graded continuous fibers. Further, by integrating the finite element simulations into the NN computational framework, we can leverage automatic differentiation for end-to-end automated sensitivity analysis, i.e., we no longer need to manually derive cumbersome sensitivity expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed method through several numerical examples involving various objective functions.

This approach combines a cohesive zone model for interface debonding and a phase field model for matrix cracking. The features of this framework are: (1) crack nucleation, propagation, and branching can be easily tracked without the need of geometric programming; (2) the interface debonding is determined merely by the CZM, but not interfered by the phase field in the bulk; (3) the cohesive interface has zero thickness instead of being regularized; (4) any reasonable cohesive law of interest is readily incorporated with very few constraints; (5) elastoplasticity of the matrix is conveniently taken into account, as strains in the model are all well defined; (6) the competition of the two failure mechanisms, namely, matrix cracking and interface debonding, is accurately captured. Accuracy of this framework is verified with existing analytical and numerical results. The proposed framework shows a potential in investigating various complicated crack behaviors in composites.",

In mathematical terms, we characterize the weak limits of sequences of Sobolev maps whose gradients on the fibers lie in the set of rotations. These limits are determined by an anisotropic constraint in the sense that they locally preserve length in the fiber direction. Our proof of the necessity emerges as a natural generalization and modification of the recently established asymptotic rigidity analysis for composites with layered reinforcements. However, the construction of approximating sequences is more delicate here due to the higher flexibility and connectedness of the soft material component. We overcome these technical challenges by a careful approximation of the identity that is constant on the rigid components, combined with a lifting in fiber bundles for Sobolev functions. The results are illustrated with several examples of attainable effective deformations. If an additional second-order regularization is introduced into the material model, only rigid body motions can occur macroscopically.",

As Fiber Reinforced Composite (FRC) is gaining wide range of application it is necessary to analyze it for stress concentration as one of the parameter. Literature survey reveals that the failure of FRC due to breakage of fiber is a cumulative process. If a fiber breaks stress concentration develops near the failure which leads to failure of other fibers in its vicinity. This process continues until the whole FRC gets failed. This phenomenon is quantified by a parameter called Stress Transfer Coefficient (STC). To analyze FRC generally it is practiced to analyze Representative Volume Element (RVE) which is a representation of the complete FRC. Another important aspect which is considered while analyzing FRC is the distribution of the fiber. Ideally the distribution of fibers should be uniform but no manufacturing process guarantees uniform distribution. Thus while analyzing FRC it is a good practice to generate RVE with randomly distributed fibers. In this paper an attempt is made to attain the relationship between volume fraction and STC. FRC with unidirectional fiber orientation is considered. RVEs with different volume fraction are analyzed. A new method is implemented to generate RVE with randomly distributed fibers. RVEs are so generated that it contains a broken fiber at its geometrical center and other fibers surrounding it. The RVE is loaded along the fiber direction.",

    "summary": "The aim of this work is to contribute in improving fibrous preforms impregnation for Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) processes. The void prediction in LCM sparks off interest within the Composite Material elaboration because it represents a significant issue to keep the expected mechanical properties of the final product. The liquid properties, the preform geometry and the flow conditions impact the void or bubble entrapped inside and outside the yarns. Nevertheless, due to the complex geometry of the reinforcement, experimental characterization of bubble formation remains delicate. Thus, our study deals with two simple model networks representing connected pores so called \"Pore Doublet Model\". A first is considering two capillaries converging on a node (T-junction) and a second is representing two capillaries interconnected with a supplying principle. In this paper, we emphasize on microfluidic and millifluidic approaches where wetting and capillary forces are significant during bubble formation mechanism.",

    "summary": "Fiber reinforcement is a crucial attribute of soft bodied muscular hydrostats that have the ability to undergo large deformations and maintain their posture. Helically wound fibers around the cylindrical worm body help control the tube diameter and length. Geometric considerations show that a fiber winding angle of 54.7 degrees, called the magic angle, results in a maximum enclosed volume. Few studies have explored the effects of differential fiber winding on the large deformation mechanics of fiber reinforced elastomers (FRE). We fabricated FRE materials in transversely isotropic layouts varying from 0-90 degrees using a custom filament winding technique and characterized the nonlinear stress-strain relationships using uniaxial and equibiaxial experiments. We used these data within a continuum mechanical framework to propose a novel constitutive model for incompressible FRE materials with embedded extensible fibers. The model includes individual contributions from the matrix and fibers in addition to coupled terms in strain invariants, I1 and I4. The deviatoric stress components show inversion at fiber orientation angles near the magic angle in the FRE composites. These results are useful in soft robotic applications and in the biomechanics of fiber reinforced tissues such as the myocardium, arteries and skin.",

The model is developed for composites with a wide range of combinations of strain hardening laws and topologies of the constituents. The theoretical foundation of the model is inspired by statistical continuum theories, leveraged by mean-field approximation of self-consistent models, and calibrated to data obtained from micromechanical finite element simulations. The model also relies on newly formulated data-driven linkages between micromechanical responses (phase-average strain rates and effective strength) and microstructure as well as strength contrast of the constituents. The paper describes in detail the theoretical development of the model, its implementation into an efficient computational plasticity framework, calibration of the linkages, and demonstration of the model predictions on two-phase composites with isotropic constituents exhibiting linear and power-law strain hardening laws. It is shown that the model reproduces finite element results reasonably well with significant savings of the computational cost.",

    "summary": "Multiscale techniques have been widely shown to potentially overcome the limitation of homogenization schemes in representing the microscopic failure mechanisms in heterogeneous media as well as their influence on their structural response at the macroscopic level. Such techniques allow the use of fully detailed models to be avoided, thus resulting in a notable decrease in the overall computational cost at fixed numerical accuracy compared to the so-called direct numerical simulations. In the present work, two different multiscale modeling approaches are presented for the analysis of microstructural instability-induced failure in locally periodic fiber-reinforced composite materials subjected to general loading conditions involving large deformations. The first approach, which is of a semi-concurrent kind, consists in the on-the-fly derivation of the macroscopic constitutive response of the composite structure together with its microscopic stability properties through a two-way computational homogenization scheme. The latter one is a novel hybrid hierarchical-concurrent multiscale approach relying on a two-level domain decomposition scheme used in conjunction with a nonlinear homogenization scheme performed at the preprocessing stage. Both multiscale approaches have been suitably validated through comparisons with reference direct numerical simulations, by which the ability of the latter approach in capturing boundary layer effects has been demonstrated.",

    "summary": "Manufacturing of aluminum alloy based casting composite materials via stir casting is one of the prominent and economical route for development and processing of metal matrix composites materials. Properties of these materials depend upon many processing parameters and selection of matrix and reinforcements. Literature reveals that most of the researchers are using 2, 6 and 7xxx aluminum matrix reinforced with SiC particles for high strength properties whereas, insufficient information is available on reinforcement of \"Al2O3\" particles in 7xxx aluminum matrix. The 7xxx series aluminum matrix usually contains Cu-Zn-Mg. Therefore, the present research was conducted to investigate the effect of elemental metal such as Cu-Zn-Mg in aluminum matrix on mechanical properties of stir casting of aluminum composite materials reinforced with alpha \"Al2O3\" particles using simple foundry melting alloying and casting route. The age hardening treatments were also applied to study the aging response of the aluminum matrix on strength, ductility and hardness. The experimental results indicate that aluminum matrix cast composite can be manufactured via conventional foundry method giving very good responses to the strength and ductility up to 10% \"Al2O3\" particles reinforced in aluminum matrix.",

    "summary": "We report fabrication method and THz characterization of composite films containing either aligned metallic (tin alloy) microwires or chalcogenide As2Se3 microwires. The microwire arrays are made by stack-and-draw fiber fabrication technique using multi-step co-drawing of low-melting-temperature metals or semiconductor glasses together with polymers. Fibers are then stacked together and pressed into composite films. Transmission through metamaterial films is studied in the whole THz range (0.1-20 THz) using a combination of FTIR and TDS. Metal containing metamaterials are found to have strong polarizing properties, while semiconductor containing materials are polarization independent and could have a designable high refractive index. Using the transfer matrix theory, we show how to retrieve the complex polarization dependent refractive index of the composite films. We then detail the selfconsistent algorithm for retrieving the optical properties of the metal alloy used in the fabrication of the metamaterial layers by using an effective medium approximation. Finally, we study challenges in fabrication of metamaterials with sub-micrometer metallic wires by repeated stack-and-draw process by comparing samples made using 2, 3 and 4 consecutive drawings. When using metallic alloys we observe phase separation effects and nano-grids formation on small metallic wires.",

It has been shown also to be a key point in the control of stratified hard / soft media coercive field in the research for optimized recording media. A signature of the exchange coupling due to the nanostructure is generally obtained on the magnetization curve $M(H)$ with a plateau characteristic of the domain wall compression at the hard/soft interface ending at the depinning of the wall inside the hard phase. This compression / depinning behavior is clearly evidenced through one dimensional description of the interface, which is rigorously possible only in stratified media.

It discovers a new way of describing multiscale heterogeneous materials by a multi-layer network structure and mechanistic building blocks. The data-driven framework of DMN is discussed in detail about the offline training and online extrapolation stages. Analytical solutions of the 3D building block with a two-layer structure in both small- and finite-strain formulations are derived based on interfacial equilibrium conditions and kinematic constraints. With linear elastic data generated by direct numerical simulations on a representative volume element (RVE), the network can be effectively trained in the offline stage using stochastic gradient descent and advanced model compression algorithms. Efficiency and accuracy of DMN on addressing the long-standing 3D RVE challenges with complex morphologies and material laws are validated through numerical experiments, including 1) hyperelastic particle-reinforced rubber composite with Mullins effect; 2) polycrystalline materials with rate-dependent crystal plasticity; 3) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites with fiber anisotropic elasticity and matrix plasticity. In particular, we demonstrate a three-scale homogenization procedure of CFRP system by concatenating the microscale and mesoscale material networks. The complete learning and extrapolation procedures of DMN establish a reliable data-driven framework for multiscale material modeling and design.",

    "summary": "This study deals with the optimisation of hybrid composite drive shafts operating at subcritical or supercritical speeds, using a genetic algorithm. A formulation for the flexural vibrations of a composite drive shaft mounted on viscoelastic supports including shear effects is developed. In particular, an analytic stability criterion is developed to ensure the integrity of the system in the supercritical regime. Then it is shown that the torsional strength can be computed with the maximum stress criterion. A shell method is developed for computing drive shaft torsional buckling. The optimisation of a helicopter tail rotor driveline is then performed. In particular, original hybrid shafts consisting of high-modulus and high-strength carbon fibre reinforced epoxy plies were studied. The solutions obtained using the method presented here made it possible to greatly decrease the number of shafts and the weight of the driveline under subcritical conditions, and even more under supercritical conditions. This study yielded some general rules for designing an optimum composite shaft without any need for optimisation algorithms.",

    "summary": "Plastic pollution, mainly from lost fishing gear composed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP), poses a significant environmental obstacle. This study evaluates the potential of recycling PP from fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fiber (GF) in the form of 3D printer filaments as a way to reduce/prevent ocean plastic. Two materials, one virgin (vPP-GF) and one made up of recycled polypropylene and virgin glass fibers (rPP-GF), were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry, tensile, and Charpy impact tests. From the results, it was found that rPP-GF often outperformed vPP-GF. rPP-GF had a higher melting and crystallization point, likely a higher crystallinity, and could withstand a higher tensile stress, while vPP-GF could withstand a higher tensile strain. Further analysis revealed the potential presence of HDPE within the rPP-GF composite, which was not reported by the manufacturer. This significantly affected the Charpy test and made it difficult to draw conclusions from the resulting data. Nevertheless, their comparability in terms of mechanical and material properties indicates the strong potential of recycling polypropylene fishnet/rope and reinforcing it with glass fibers to extend their lifespan and reduce ocean plastic.",

Here, emulating nature, efforts have been made to develop a new class of tin based alloy/composite with liquid metal reinforcement (LMM). Based on thermodynamic calculations, a composition has been designed such that on melting and casting it forms a solid metal (tin solid solution) and the eutectic mixture remains in liquid form at room temperature. The composite structure named as LMM shows multifold improvement in hardness, strength, ductility, toughness and wear resistance as compared to conventional solder alloys. A Finite Element Method (FEM) based simulation shows strain distribution in the composite which results in the unique behavior. The LMM also shows a negative coefficient of thermal expansion which is further verified using in-situ microscopy and thermodynamic calculations.",

Here, the deformation and failure behavior of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ interfaces and their components, metal and ceramic, are analyzed in depth using molecular statics calculations. A number of atomistic simulations of strength tests, uniaxial tensile, uniaxial compressive and simple shear, have been performed in order to obtain a set of stiffness tensors and strain-stress characteristics up to failure for 30 different crystalline and amorphous systems. Characteristic points on the strain-stress curves in the vicinity of failure are further analyzed at the atomistic level, using local measures of lattice disorder. Numerical results are discussed in the context of composite damage at upper microscopic scale based on images of the fracture surface of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ composites.",

In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders.

    "summary": "The effective macroscopic response of nonlinear elastomeric inhomogeneous materials is of great interest in many applications including nonlinear composite materials and soft biological tissues. The interest of the present work is associated with a microsphere composite material, which is modelled as a matrix-inclusion composite. The matrix phase is a homogeneous isotropic nonlinear rubber-like material and the inclusion phase is more complex, consisting of a distribution of sizes of stiff thin spherical shells filled with gas. Experimentally, such materials have been shown to undergo complex deformation under cyclic loading. Here, we consider microspheres embedded in an unbounded host material and assume that a hydrostatic pressure is applied in the \"far-field\". Taking into account a variety of effects including buckling of the spherical shells, large deformation of the host phase and evolving microstructure, we derive a model predicting the pressure-relative volume change load curves. Nonlinear constitutive behaviour of the matrix medium is accounted for by employing neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin incompressible models. Moreover a nearly-incompressible solution is derived via asymptotic analysis for a spherical cavity embedded in un unbounded isotropic homogeneous hyperelastic medium loaded hydrostatically. The load-curve predictions reveal a strong dependence on the microstructure of the composite, including distribution of microspheres, the stiffness of the shells, and on the initial volume fraction of the inclusions, whereas there is only a modest dependence on the characteristic properties of the nonlinear elastic model used for the rubber host.",

    "summary": "In the manufacturing process of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) mirrors (replicated from a mandrel) the orientation of the unidirectional carbon fiber layers (layup) has a direct influence on different aspects of the final product, like its general (large scale) shape and local deformations. In particular, optical methods used to evaluate the surface's quality, can reveal the presence of print-through, a very common issue in CFPR manufacture. In practical terms, the surface's irregularities induced, among other artifacts, by print-through, produce unwanted scattering effects, which are usually mitigated applying extra layers of different materials to the surface. Since one of the main goals of CFPR mirrors is to decrease the final weight of the whole mirror system, adding more material goes in the opposite direction of that. For this reason a different layup method is being developed with the goal of decreasing print-through and improving sphericity while maintaining mechanical qualities and without the addition of extra material in the process.",

    "summary": "This article deals with the study of predicting the confinement effect of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) on concrete cylinder strength using metaheuristics-based artificial neural networks. A detailed database of 708 CFRP confined concrete cylinders is developed from previously published research with information on 8 parameters including geometrical parameters like the diameter (d) and height (h) of a cylinder, unconfined compressive strength of concrete (fco'), thickness (nt), the elastic modulus of CFRP (Ef), unconfined concrete strain confined concrete strain and the ultimate compressive strength of confined concrete fcc'. Three metaheuristic models are implemented including particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and bat algorithm (BA). These algorithms are trained on the data using an objective function of mean square error and their predicted results are validated against the experimental studies and finite element analysis. The study shows that the hybrid model of PSO predicted the strength of CFRP-confined concrete cylinders with maximum accuracy of 99.13% and GWO predicted the results with an accuracy of 98.17%. The high accuracy of axial compressive strength predictions demonstrated that these prediction models are a reliable solution to the empirical methods. The prediction models are especially suitable for avoiding full-scale time-consuming experimental tests that make the process quick and economical.",

These periodic configurations can be therefore used to achieve physical and chemical properties difficult to achieve with homogeneous materials. To predict the magnetic behavior of such composite materials is of prime importance for applications. The main objective of this paper is to perform, by means of Gamma-convergence and two-scale convergence, a rigorous derivation of the homogenized Gibbs-Landau free energy functional associated to a composite periodic ferromagnetic material, i.e. a ferromagnetic material in which the heterogeneities are periodically distributed inside the ferromagnetic media. We thus describe the Gamma-limit of the Gibbs-Landau free energy functional, as the period over which the heterogeneities are distributed inside the ferromagnetic body shrinks to zero.",

Special emphasis is placed on the modelling of the deformation and failure behaviour of the composite material.

Depending on the polymeric matrix, viscoelastic effects can interfere particularly with the long-term behaviour of the joint. We propose a systematic approach to the modelling of composite laminates, discuss limitations of the used model, and present details of parameter identification.\n  Homogenisation techniques are applied to predict the mechanical behaviour of the composite in terms of effective anisotropic elastic and viscoelastic material properties. In combination with a continuum damage approach this model represents the deformation and failure behaviour of individual laminae. Cohesive zone elements enable the modelling of delamination processes. The parameters of the latter models are identified from experiments. The defined material model for the composite is eventually utilised in the simulation of an exemplary self-piercing rivetting process.",

    "summary": "We present experimental evidence for an anomalous decrease in stiffness in a fiber-reinforced polymer composite because of the embedded fiber. A shell with carbon fiber showed about 20% less stiffness and 100% more strength under compressive loading. We ruled out the role of debonding of fiber due to imperfect impregnation by using a fiber-pullout test, which revealed that the fiber-matrix interface is strong in the direction of the fiber. Therefore, we hypothesize that a fiber allows the matrix material to rotate around it as in a hinge. We corroborate this phenomenon, which we call the hinge effect, with analytical modelling and experimental data for small and large deformations of a fiber embedded in slender composite beams. We also demonstrate the design of foldable and deployable sheets with hill and valley folds enabled by the embedded fibers. Moreover, the hinge effect warrants further research into physics of how fibers in slender composite structures give rise to the anomalous flexibility. This effect can be gainfully used in designing novel origami structures and compliant mechanisms should be flexible and strong.",

These DMNs need to be identified by linear elastic precomputations on representative volume elements, and serve as high-fidelity surrogates for full-field simulations on microstructures with inelastic constituents. We discuss how to extend direct DMNs to account for varying fiber orientation, and propose a simplified sampling strategy which significantly speeds up the training process. To enable concurrent multiscale simulations, evaluating the DMNs efficiently is crucial. We discuss dedicated techniques for exploiting sparsity and high-performance linear algebra modules, and demonstrate the power of the proposed approach on an industrial-scale three-dimensional component. Indeed, the DMN is capable of accelerating two-scale simulations significantly, providing possible speed-ups of several magnitudes.",

    "summary": "A novel homogenization methodology is proposed for analyzing the failure of fiber-reinforced composite materials, utilizing elastic and eigen influence tensors within a damage informed transformation field analysis (D-TFA) framework. This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.",

    "summary": "We present formulation and open-source tools to achieve in-material model predictive control of sensor/actuator systems using learned forward kinematics and on-device computation. Microcontroller units (MCUs) that compute the prediction and control task while colocated with the sensors and actuators enable in-material untethered behaviors. In this approach, small parameter size neural network models learn forward kinematics offline. Our open-source compiler, nn4mc, generates code to offload these predictions onto MCUs. A Newton-Raphson solver then computes the control input in real time. We first benchmark this nonlinear control approach against a PID controller on a mass-spring-damper simulation. We then study experimental results on two experimental rigs with different sensing, actuation and computational hardware: a tendon-based platform with embedded LightLace sensors and a HASEL-based platform with magnetic sensors. Experimental results indicate effective high-bandwidth tracking of reference paths (greater than or equal to 120 Hz) with a small memory footprint (less than or equal to 6.4% of flash memory). The measured path following error does not exceed 2mm in the tendon-based platform. The simulated path following error does not exceed 1mm in the HASEL-based platform. The mean power consumption of this approach in an ARM Cortex-M4f device is 45.4 mW. This control approach is also compatible with Tensorflow Lite models and equivalent on-device code. In-material intelligence enables a new class of composites that infuse autonomy into structures and systems with refined artificial proprioception.",
