The discovery of novel intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnets and the development of robust synthesis strategies, therefore, remain significant challenges. Here, we report the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of CrOCl monolayer films and nanosheets that exhibit excellent air stability. The CrOCl morphology is tunable, ranging from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional flower-like structures, with lateral sizes ranging from several microns to continuous monolayer films.

Furthermore, magnetic measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal a Néel temperature for CrOCl of ~14 K.

However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.",

Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the Néel temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.",

    "summary": "Proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) achieve high efficiency at reduced operating temperatures, but their performance is often limited by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. The BaCoFeZrY (BCFZY) perovskite family is a promising triple-conducting air-electrode material, yet the role of Y dopants in governing oxygen transport remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effect of Y content on oxygen conductivity in three compositions: BCFZ, BCFZY0.1, and BCFY. Oxygen conductivity was evaluated from the product of oxygen tracer diffusivity and oxygen defect concentration. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine tracer diffusivity and migration energies, while defect concentrations were estimated from reference data. Y doping slightly decreases oxygen conductivity from BCFZ to BCFZY0.1, from 337 to 203 mS/cm at 500 C, with activation energies of 0.155 and 0.172 eV. BCFY shows much lower conductivity (99 mS/cm) and a higher activation energy of 0.261 eV. Computed conductivities are higher and more Arrhenius-like than experimental values, suggesting that microstructural features such as grain boundaries strongly limit oxygen transport in real materials. A series-circuit model combining bulk conductivity and fitted grain-boundary parameters provides semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. These results clarify the role of Y doping in oxygen transport and provide insight for optimizing cathode performance in PCFCs.",

Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state.

    "summary": "Understanding degradation processes in lithium ion batteries is essential for improving long term performance and advancing sustainable energy technologies. Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising anode material due to the high theoretical capacity of tin. Unlike conventional intercalation based electrodes, SnSe undergoes conversion and alloying reactions with lithium to form Li4.4Sn, Sn, and Li2Se, enabling high lithium storage but inducing large volume changes that cause mechanical instability and capacity fading. Embedding SnSe nanoparticles within a Ti3C2Tx MXene framework offers a strategy to mitigate these effects by enhancing conductivity and structural resilience. Here, cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo FIB) slice and view revealed progressive material redistribution and morphological transformation during cycling, underscoring the need for site specific chemical analysis. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo APT) of selected regions provided high spatial and chemical resolution while preserving beam sensitive phases, uncovering nanoscale degradation mechanisms including phase transformations, partial dissolution of active material, and, importantly, the first direct evidence of copper corrosion and copper ion migration from the current collector into the electrode. The observation of copper redistribution demonstrates that current collector degradation contributes directly to chemical contamination and capacity fading in composite electrodes. Together, cryo FIB and cryo APT provide a powerful workflow for elucidating electrode degradation in reactive, beam sensitive systems, offering critical insights for designing more durable and stable next generation battery materials.",

    "summary": "Reinforced concrete rail bridges are essential components of railway infrastructure, where reliability, durability, and adaptability are key design priorities. However, the design process is often complicated by uncertainties stemming from unforeseen construction constraints, such as the need to reposition piers or alter geometric characteristics. These design adaptations can lead to repeated redesigns, added costs, and project delays if not anticipated in the early design stages, as well as significant computational overhead when using traditional finite element (FE) simulations. To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions. By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software. This FE model is used to generate the required design of experiments to train the surrogate models. Within this framework, a comparative performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Kriging surrogate against alternative methods, including polynomial chaos expansion (implemented in UQLab) and support vector regression (SVR). This methodology supports early-stage uncertainty-informed design, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of reinforced concrete rail bridges in the face of practical constraints and changing site conditions.",

In this study, we investigate how lithological controls influence fault permeability using the PREDICT framework: a probabilistic workflow that couples stochastic fault geometry generation, physically constrained material placement, and flow-based upscaling. The flow-based upscaling step, however, is a very computationally expensive component of the workflow and presents a major bottleneck that makes global sensitivity analysis (GSA) intractable, as it requires millions of model evaluations. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network surrogate to emulate the flow-based upscaling step. This surrogate model dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, thereby making GSA feasible. The surrogate-model-enabled GSA reveals new insights into the effects of lithological controls on fault permeability. In addition to identifying dominant parameters and negligible ones, the analysis uncovers significant nonlinear interactions between parameters that cannot be captured by traditional local sensitivity methods.",

    "summary": "We present a forward prediction material screening framework designed to discover Pd-Cu alloys with improved B2 phase stability, thereby unlocking simultaneous $H_2$ generation and utilization. First, we trained CatBoost models with literature-derived Pd alloy data to predict $H_2$ permeability from composition and testing conditions. We evaluated fractional, composition-based, and physics-informed descriptors, individually and in combination, and showed that sequential Pearson filtering and fold-wise SHAP-based recursive feature elimination with cross-fold aggregation reduced errors while controlling complexity. Guided by the one-SE rule, a narrower domain-informed set of 13 features provided the best accuracy parsimony trade-off ($R^2=0.81$), only 0.01 below the max. $R^2$ achievable with 3x the number of features. SHAP analysis indicated that high permeability is promoted by elevated temperature, lattice expansion relative to Pd, atomic size mismatch, and favorable mixing tendencies. Second, the selected model was applied to screen $Pd_{(100-x-y)}Cu_{x}M_{y}$ spanning 16 co-dopants M for B2 stabilization. For each M system, we obtained the Pareto set of compositions that minimize Pd content and Miedema heat of formation and maximize the permeability, then picked three compounds, including that with the highest predicted permeability, the lowest Miedema heat of formation, and the lowest Pd content. With a final filter considering M concentration for single-phase Pd-M solution formation, we recommend Pd48.48Cu43.00Y8.52, Pd49.08Cu42.45Sc8.47, Pd56.09Cu33.70La10.21, and Pd52.68Cu40.44Mg6.88 for experimental validation. We predict those alloys to exhibit permeabilities 1.7 to 1.9 higher than B2 Pd60Cu40. Our framework provides plausible experimental targets and a scalable pathway for designing stable, high-temperature, H2-selective Pd-alloy membranes.",

Here we develop a first-principles-inspired quantum-statistics-based theoretical analysis of the ferroelectric order and interfacial superconductivity in lightly-doped quantum paraelectric, niobium (Nb)-doped KTaO$_3$. We demonstrate that local distortions induced by the doped Nb atoms beyond its quantum critical composition induce a long-range ferroelectric order. The predicted dielectric properties quantitatively agree with the experimental measurements over the entire temperature range from the symmetry-broken ferroelectric phase across the phase transition to the paraelectric region. As the same soft phonon mode that governs dielectric behavior provides the essential pairing channel for interfacial superconductivity of KTaO$_3$, we predict a pronounced enhancement of this superconductivity on (111) surface when the system is tuned to its quantum-critical composition via Nb doping, providing a concrete avenue for experimental verification. This finding establishes ferroelectric quantum criticality as a unique design principle for engineering enhanced superconductivity and discovering emergent quantum phases in polar oxide heterostructures, explicitly suggesting that similar materials-tuning strategies (e.g., epitaxial strain) could be exploited to enhance superconductivity in quantum paraelectric systems.",

    "summary": "The HyperScout-H (HS-H) instrument is one of the payloads aboard ESA's Hera spacecraft. Hera is a planetary defence mission that aims to provide a detailed characterization of the near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos-Dimorphos after the NASA/DART mission impact. HS-H is a versatile dual-use payload, functioning as a hyperspectral imager that captures both images and spectral data within the 0.65--0.95 $μ$m wavelength range. The observations from this instrument will offer key insights regarding the composition of the two bodies Didymos and Dimorphos, space weathering effects, and the potential presence of exogenous material on these asteroids. Thanks to its wide field of view ($\\approx 15.5^\\circ \\times 8.3^\\circ$ in paraxial approximation), HS-H will be able to monitor the system's orbital dynamic and dust environment. At the same time, both components of this binary asteroid remain in the field of view for most of the asteroid phase of the mission. These results also complement the data obtained from other instruments in characterizing the geomorphological units. The data that will be obtained by HS-H will enable the creation of maps highlighting key spectral features, such as taxonomic classification, spectral slope, and band parameters. This article presents the pre-flight calibration of the instrument, outlines the science objectives, and discusses the expected investigations. The instrument's capabilities are demonstrated through laboratory observations of two meteorite samples and a dedicated software toolbox was developed specifically for processing the instrument's data.",

    "summary": "Hydrogen is a promising clean energy carrier, yet effective and reversible storage remains challenging. AB3-type intermetallic alloys are promising for solid-state hydrogen storage due to intermediate thermodynamic stability and rapid hydrogen uptake. Optimizing stability and gravimetric density is hindered by competing thermodynamic and magnetic effects. Here, we analyze AB3 compounds (A = Ca, Y, Mg; B = Co, Ni) and ternary alloys CaxYyMg1-x-yB3 using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find a direct correlation between formation energy and total magnetic moment that dictates alloy stability, explaining the trade-off in hydrogen storage. In Co-rich systems with large lattice volumes, formation energy rises with magnetization, showing magnetism as the dominant factor. Mg-rich compositions achieve high gravimetric densities, but strong magnetism destabilizes the system, requiring Y substitution to suppress magnetic moments. Replacing Co with Ni weakens magnetism: YNi3 is nonmagnetic, while CaNi3 and MgNi3 are weakly polarized, allowing thermodynamic stability across compositions. Notably, CaMg2Ni9 combines high theoretical capacity (3.32 wt%) with good reversibility. Mg-rich Ni-based alloys are predicted to offer negative formation energies with the highest gravimetric densities (up to 3.40 wt%). These results show that controlling magnetism via transition-metal substitution is key to overcoming the stability-capacity trade-off in AB3 hydrogen storage materials.",

These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.",

    "summary": "Hydrothermal synthesis offers an economical and scalable way to produce nanodiamonds under relatively mild, low-pressure and low-temperature conditions. However,its sustainability and the detailed mechanisms behind diamond formation in such environments are still not fully understood. In this work, we designed ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using different CHO-based molecular precursors containing COOH and OH groups, such as organic acids, polyols, sugars, and polysaccharides.The reactions were carried out at 190 degrees Centigrade in chlorinated, strongly alkaline aqueous solutions with alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed the presence of diamond-specific lattice planes and sp3-hybridized carbon structures. Our results show that the type of precursor, its molecular size, and the ionic composition of the solution play key roles in determining the defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the resulting nanodiamonds. Atomic-scale imaging showed both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns. These observations provide direct insight into how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems. Overall, the study positions hydrothermal synthesis as a sustainable, chemistry-driven, and tunable approach for creating nanodiamonds tailored for applications in quantum technologies, biomedicine, catalysis, and advanced materials.",

    "summary": "Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.",

    "summary": "Recently, Ksenofontov et al (arXiv:2510.03256) observed ambient pressure room-temperature superconductivity in graphite intercalated with lithium-based alloys with transition temperature (according to magnetization measurements) $T_c=330$ $K$. Here, I analyzed the reported temperature dependent resistivity data $ρ(T)$ in these graphite-intercalated samples and found that $ρ(T)$ is well described by the model of two series resistors, where each resistor is described as either an Einstein conductor or a Bloch-Grüneisen conductor. Deduced Einstein and Debye temperatures are $Θ_{E,1} \\approx 250$ $K$ and $Θ_{E,2} \\approx 1,600$ $K$, and $Θ_{D,1} \\approx 300$ $K$ and $Θ_{D,2} \\approx 2,200$ $K$, respectively. Following the McMillan formalism, from the deduced $Θ_{E,2}$ and $Θ_{D,2}$, the electron-phonon coupling constant $λ_{e-ph} = 2.2 - 2.6$ was obtained. This value of $λ_{e-ph}$ is approximately equal to the value of $λ_{e-ph}$ in highly compressed superconducting hydrides. Based on this, I can propose that the observed room-temperature superconductivity in intercalated graphite is localized in nanoscale Sr-Ca-Li metallic flakes/particles, which adopt the phonon spectrum from the surrounding bulk graphite matrix, and as a result, conventional electron-phonon superconductivity arises in these nano-flakes/particles at room temperature. Experimental data reported by Ksenofontov et al (arXiv:2510.03256) on trapped magnetic flux decay in intercalated graphite samples supports the proposition.",

The present work investigates the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/Hβcd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with $Hβcd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with $Hβcd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/Hβcd$ with the layered sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $μ$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $μ$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $μ$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $μ$A $μM^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone, melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor. Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of $Cu_2S/Hβcd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR.",

The SR showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $μ$M and 4.28 to 403.14 $μ$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM or 0.0012 $μ$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $μ$A $μM^{-1}$ $cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone, melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor. Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of $Cu_2S/Hβcd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR."

    "summary": "Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001, which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.",

The method is based on two-directional beam tracking (2DBT), which requires only a single optical element and is compatible with standard x-ray sources and detectors. We validate the system's capabilities through imaging of a custom-built phantom, a fibre-reinforced composite and ex-vivo biological tissues, including a bovine intervertebral disc, a rat heart, and a porcine meniscus. The results show that dark-field tomography provides complementary information to attenuation as well as to phase tomography, by revealing sub-resolution features such as fibre orientation and microstructural heterogeneity at length scales that are well below the voxel size. A key element of our system is its sensitivity to scattering along two orthogonal directions in the image plane, enabling the measurement of scattering anisotropy with a single exposure. As well as simple and robust, our approach is sensitive and precise. These findings demonstrate the potential of 2DBT for non-destructive and three-dimensional structural characterisation of samples and materials in engineering, materials science and biomedical applications.",

In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence of surface contamination in STM measurements.",

However, the problem of designing such self-assembly is complex, and an effective simulation is necessary to assist in searching for appropriate design protocols. Typical computational methodologies such as molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics have limited ability to access the long time scales required for these hierarchical self-assembly processes. Here we adopt a particle-based reaction-diffusion algorithm to model the spatial-temporal evolution of hundreds to thousands of micron-scale DNA-coated colloid self-assembly process over hours. In order to demonstrate the capability of this digital twin, we compared its predicted core-shell assembly process to results from experiments. The model can qualitatively reproduce the core-shell structures observed in experiment by recapitulating the emergence of compositional heterogeneity when delays between distinct assembly times are introduced. These results support the idea that this approach can successfully capture dynamics over long time scales and the appropriate scale of structure formation. We then use the model to explore different protocols for structure evolution, suggesting how this tool can aid in the design of complex self-organization processes.",

Powder X-ray diffraction is a key technique in this pursuit due to its versatility and reliability.

Here, we introduce a physics-guided contrastive learning framework termed as XCCP. It aligns powder diffraction patterns with candidate crystal structures in a shared embedding space to enable efficient structure retrieval and symmetry recognition. The XRD encoder employs a dual-expert design with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network projection head, one branch emphasizes low angle reflections reflecting long-range order, while the other captures dense high angle peaks shaped by symmetry. Coupled with a crystal graph encoder, contrastive pretraining yields physically grounded representations. XCCP demonstrates strong performance across tasks, with structure retrieval reaching 0.89 and space group identification attains 0.93 accuracy. The framework further generalizes to compositionally similar multi principal element alloys and demonstrates zero-shot transfer to experimental patterns. These results establish XCCP as a robust, interpretable, and scalable approach that offers a new paradigm for X-ray diffraction analysis. XCCP facilitates high-throughput screening, rapid structural validation and integration into autonomous laboratories.",

We identify two new contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states, while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections.

Our findings may contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics."

Although experimental studies have shown that the interfacial bonding properties of SiCN films vary with SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters, a clear correlation between these parameters and the resulting bonding properties has not yet been established. This study presents an atomistic investigation of SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding with controlled SiCN composition and plasma fluence, which performs O2 plasma surface activation, surface hydroxylation, direct bonding, post-bonding annealing, and debonding using reactive molecular dynamics. The structural characterization of the plasma-activated SiCN surface, including density of various covalent bonds and surface roughness, exhibits composition- and plasma fluence-dependent chemical and morphological modification. Bonding energy evaluated from atomic traction-separation responses in cohesive zone volume elements (CZVE) during debonding simulations shows a positive correlation with the interfacial Si-O-Si density. Since the interfacial Si-O-Si density reflects the combined effects of these chemical and morphological modifications, the dependence of bonding energy on composition and plasma fluence is successfully elucidated by the structural characterization. These results establish an atomic-level material-process-property relationship and offer practical guidance for optimizing SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters for SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding.",

Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm) enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels.

    "summary": "The pursuit of immersive and structurally aware multimedia experiences has intensified interest in sensing modalities that reconstruct objects beyond the limits of visible light. Conventional optical pipelines degrade under occlusion or low illumination, motivating the use of radio-frequency (RF) sensing, whose electromagnetic waves penetrate materials and encode both geometric and compositional information. Yet, uncontrolled multipath propagation restricts reconstruction accuracy. Recent advances in Programmable Wireless Environments (PWEs) mitigate this limitation by enabling software-defined manipulation of propagation through Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), thereby providing controllable illumination diversity. Building on this capability, this work introduces a PWE-driven RF framework for three-dimensional object reconstruction using material-aware spherical primitives. The proposed approach combines RIS-enabled field synthesis with a Detection Transformer (DETR) that infers spatial and material parameters directly from extracted RF features. Simulation results confirm the framework's ability to approximate object geometries and classify material composition with an overall accuracy of 79.35%, marking an initial step toward programmable and physically grounded RF-based 3D object composition visualization.",

Boosting the integrated performance of these hybrid systems demands techniques capable of probing local variations of the physical properties inaccessible to bulk analysis. Here, we report the single-particle dielectric characterization of hybrid, semiconducting bismuth sulfide (Bi$_2$S$_3$) nanorods (NR) decorated with metallic Au nanoparticles (NP), employing scanning dielectric microscopy, which uses electrostatic force microscopy in combination with finite-element numerical simulations. We reveal a pronounced enhancement in the local dielectric response of Bi$_2$S$_3$ upon Au decoration, attributed to interfacial polarization and electron transfer from Au to the Bi$_2$S$_3$ matrix, thus suggesting a semiconductor-to-metal-like transition at the single-particle level. Numerical simulations show that the response is dominated by the vertical component of the permittivity and that the decorating metallic Au NP produce only moderate shielding of the semiconductor Bi$_2$S$_3$ NR core, indicating that the large increase in the dielectric response originates primarily from intrinsic modifications within the NR. Overall, these findings provide direct insight into structure--property relationships at the single-particle level, supporting the rational design of advanced hybrid nanostructures with tailored electronic functionalities.",

    "summary": "The objective of developing bio-based composite sandwich structures with greener core materials is to facilitate the decarbonization of industries such as aviation and maritime. This field of research has received increasing attention over the past decades. For example, balsa wood has emerged as a highly promising alternative to foam or honeycomb cores, offering a lightweight, rapidly renewable and cost-effective solution. However, plant fibers such as balsa wood and flax often display high hydrophilic behavior, which could affect their mechanical performance and long-term durability. It is therefore imperative to promote further research into the characterization of the cyclic hygrothermal aging behavior of balsa wood core sandwich structures, in particular the identification of moistureinduced strains and internal stresses in the skins and cores, as well as the investigation of moisture desorption processes and the associated thermal shrinkage phenomena in wood fibers, resins and glass fibers. Accordingly, this work employs two complete moisture absorption-desorption cycles to characterize the moisture diffusion behavior of specimens comprising three different materials, including the pure balsa wood, resin-infused balsa and balsa core sandwich structures with two Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) skins. The changes in moisture content and hygroscopic strains in the thickness, length and width directions of all specimens were investigated with a view to identifying the hygroscopic swelling and thermal shrinkage behaviors exhibited during long-term aging cycles.",

The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.",

Beyond topological superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations. HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} = 0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants. This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain (BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase (after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV Å and 2.42 eV Å, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.",

However, their higher electrical resistivity makes them susceptible to lightning strike damage, which necessitates the addition of a surface lightning strike protection (LSP) layer. Traditional LSP systems, such as copper mesh or expanded foil, reduce lightning strike damage, but are not easily drapable around complex geometries and may introduce delamination-prone regions within the composite. Here, we propose a novel manufacturing strategy for architected hybrid composites as drapable LSP by weaving stainless steel yarns within the woven carbon fiber composites. We varied the metal-to-carbon yarn ratio and stacking configuration to assess damage evolution under quasi-static arc exposures and simulated lightning strikes. Our results elucidate that incorporating hybrid layers into composites significantly reduced surface temperatures, through-thickness damage, and mass loss under both electric arc impacts. The composites with the proposed LSP layers also exhibited higher retention of flexural modulus and strength compared to the reference CFRP. Advanced air mobility (AAM) vehicles, which operate at lower altitudes, face significant safety challenges due to their high susceptibility to lightning strikes. Therefore, the proposed hybridized composites can be used as an efficient and drapable LSP around complex shapes in AAM vehicles, offering enhanced safety and protection.",

Advanced air mobility (AAM) vehicles, which operate at lower altitudes, face significant safety challenges due to their high susceptibility to lightning strikes. Therefore, the proposed hybridized composites can be used as an efficient and drapable LSP around complex shapes in AAM vehicles, offering enhanced safety and protection."

Given the hierarchical nature of these materials, it is essential to understand the governing mechanisms and organization of its constituents across length scales for bio-inspired structural design. Despite recent advances in transmission electron miscoscopy (TEM) that have allowed us to witness the fascinating arrangement of bone at micro-down to the nano-scale, we are still missing the details about the structural organization and mechanical properties of the main building blocks of bone -- mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs). Here, we propose a novel approach for extracting individual MCFs from nature's model material via a dropcasting procedure. By isolating the MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, we visualized the arrangement of organic and mineral phases within the individual MCFs at the nanoscale. Using a 4D-STEM approach, the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs was examined. Furthermore, we conducted first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments, revealing exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs. The capabilities of TEM allow us to resolve MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale level.

    "summary": "Soils and sediments are soft, amorphous materials with complex microstructures and mechanical properties, that are also building blocks for industrial materials such as concrete. These Earth-mediated materials evolve under prolonged environmental pressures like mechanical stress, chemical gradients, and biological activity. Here, we introduce geomimicry, a new paradigm for designing sustainable materials by learning from the emergent and adaptive dynamics of Earth-mediated matter. Drawing a parallel to biomimicry, we posit that these geomaterials follow evolutionary design rules, optimizing their structure and function in response to persistent natural forces. Our central argument is that by decoding these rules: primarily through understanding the emergence of novel exotic properties from multiscale interactions between heterogenous components, we can engineer a new class of adaptive, sustainable matter. We propose two complementary approaches here. The top-down approach looks to nature to identify building blocks and map them to functional groups defined by their mechanical (rather than chemical) behaviors, and then examine how environmental training tunes interactions among these groups. The bottom up approach seeks to leverage and test this framework, building earth materials one component at a time under prescribed fluctuating stresses that guide assembly of complex and out-of-equilibrium materials. The goal is to create materials with programmed functionalities, such as erosion resistance or self-healing capabilities. Geomimicry offers a pathway to truly design Earth-mediated circular materials, with potential applications ranging from climate-resilient soils and smart agriculture to new insights into planetary terraforming, fundamentally shifting the focus from static compositions to dynamic, evolving systems that are mediated via their environment.",

    "summary": "This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.",

    "summary": "Perovskite materials are at the forefront of modern materials science due to their exceptional structural, electronic, and optical properties. The controlled fabrication of perovskite nanostructures is crucial for enhancing their performance, stability, and scalability, directly impacting their applications in next-generation devices such as solar cells, LEDs, and sensors. Here, we present a novel, ligand-free approach to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with average sizes up to 100 nm, using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air without additional liquid media. We demonstrate this method for both organic-inorganic (methylamino lead) hybrid perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) and fully inorganic lead-free double perovskites (Cs2AgBiX6, X = Cl, Br), achieving high-purity NCs without stabilizing ligands - a critical advancement over conventional chemical synthesis methods. By tailoring laser parameters, we systematically elucidate the influence of perovskite composition (halide type, organic vs. inorganic cation, single versus double perovskite structure) on the ablation process and the resulting nanocrystal properties. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirm the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX3 forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs2AgBiX6 forming smaller (approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals pronounced size-dependent blue shifts (17-40 nm) due to quantum confinement, particularly for Br and I containing perovskites. This clean, scalable, and versatile PLA approach not only provides direct access to high-purity, ligand-free perovskite NCs with tunable optical properties but also represents a significant advance in the fabrication of nanostructures, enabling the exploration of new perovskite-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.",

However, their widespread application remains hindered by challenges such as anisotropic crystal growth, composition control and lack of knowledge on optoelectronic properties. A deeper understanding of the intrinsic limitations of these materials, as well as viable defect mitigation strategies like the engineering of solid solutions, is critical. This work presents a low-temperature synthesis route based on molecular ink deposition enabling direct crystallization of tunable Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions without need for binary chalcogenide precursors. This approach yields phase-pure films with precise control over morphology, composition, and crystallographic orientation. XRD analysis and DFT calculations confirm the formation of homogeneous solid solutions, while optoelectronic measurements reveal the distinct roles of halogen and chalcogen anions in tuning bandgap energy and carrier type, with Se shifting downwards the conduction band. The versatility of this synthesis technique enables morphology control ranging from compact films to rod-shaped microcrystals, expanding the functional adaptability of these materials. These findings offer a foundational framework for defect engineering and the scalable integration of chalcohalides in next-generation energy technologies, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and chemical sensing.",

This unprecedented composition, combined with substantial absolute CO levels (CO/H2O = 1.65+-0.09) and red spectral slopes, provides direct evidence for galactic cosmic ray (GCR) processing of the outer layers of the interstellar comet nucleus. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation efficiently converts CO to CO2 while synthesizing organic-rich crusts, suggesting that the outer layers of 3I/ATLAS consist of irradiated material which properties are consistent with the observed composition of 3I/ATLAS coma and with its observed spectral reddening. Estimates of the erosion rate of 3I/ATLAS indicate that current outgassing samples the GCR-processed zone only (depth ~15-20 m), never reaching pristine interior material. Outgassing of pristine material after perihelion remains possible, though it is considered unlikely. This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects primarily reveal GCR-processed material rather than pristine material representative of their primordial formation environments. With 3I/ATLAS approaching perihelion in October 2025, immediate follow-up observations are critical to confirm this interpretation and establish GCR processing as a fundamental evolutionary pathway for interstellar objects.",

    "summary": "In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the \"gram-scale weight reduction\" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding \"lightweight performance\" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with \"proton density\" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10).

      "value": "In the field of deep space radiation shielding design, traditional high-Z metals are being progressively replaced by novel low-Z materials such as hydrogenated graphene foam, polyethylene-carbon nanotube composite fibers, and boron-rich hydrogen-containing metal-organic frameworks. This transition stems from the constraints of the \"gram-scale weight reduction\" bottleneck. However, the mechanisms behind these materials' outstanding \"lightweight performance\" remain at the purely phenomenological level. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a ternary coupled semi-empirical model, with \"proton density\" (rho_p) as the core independent variable (equivalent to electron density), establishing correlations with full absorption threshold (Eth) and proton utilization rate (eta_p). To validate the model's practicality in complex system design, we embedded it into the NSGA-II genetic algorithm (POP=20, MAXGEN=10).

To address this, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to investigate the structural and defect-related physical properties in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N. The MLIP is first validated by reproducing the equation of state, lattice constants, and elastic constants of the binary endpoints, GaN and AlN, as well as known defect formation and migration energies from density functional theory and empirical potentials. We then apply the MLIP to evaluate elastic constants of AlGaN alloys, which reveals a non-linear relation with alloying effect. Our results reveal that nitrogen Frenkel pair formation energies and the migration barriers for nitrogen point defects are highly sensitive to the local chemical environment and migration path. In contrast, Ga and Al vacancy migration energies remain relatively insensitive to alloy composition, whereas their interstitial migration energies exhibit stronger compositional dependence. These results provide quantitative insight into how alloying influences defect energetics in AlGaN, informing defect engineering strategies for improved material performance.",

Conventional strategies often rely on filler incorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and constrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of Spirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical filament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their morphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the key parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions exhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield stress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in bending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture surface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out (in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating structure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement as a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance through microstructural architecture.",

Here, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability, whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers, suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide perovskites.",

Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents (e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies, which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved 81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.",

Transition metals Mn and Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly.

In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned.

However, these properties also pose significant challenges in designing the morphologies and controllers of soft robots. The relatively short history of this field has not yet produced sufficient knowledge to consistently derive optimal solutions. Consequently, an automated process for the design of soft robot morphologies can be extremely helpful. This study focusses on the cooperative NeuroCoEvolution of networks that are indirect representations of soft robot actuators. Both the morphologies and controllers represented by Compositional Pattern Producing Networks are evolved using the well-established method NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (CPPN-NEAT). The CoEvolution of controllers and morphologies is implemented using the top n individuals from the cooperating population, with various averaging methods tested to determine the fitness of the evaluated individuals. The test-case application for this research is the optimisation of a soft actuator for a drug delivery system. The primary metric used is the maximum displacement of one end of the actuator in a specified direction. Additionally, the robustness of the evolved morphologies is assessed against a range of randomly generated controllers to simulate potential noise in real-world applications. The results of this investigation indicate that CPPN-NEAT produces superior morphologies compared to previously published results from multi-objective optimisation, with reduced computational effort and time. Moreover, the best configuration is found to be CoEvolution with the two best individuals from the cooperative population and the averaging of their fitness using the weighted mean method.",

The results of this investigation indicate that CPPN-NEAT produces superior morphologies compared to previously published results from multi-objective optimisation, with reduced computational effort and time. Moreover, the best configuration is found to be CoEvolution with the two best individuals from the cooperative population and the averaging of their fitness using the weighted mean method."

    "summary": "Strong evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been very recently reported experimentally in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and gathered a significant amount of interest. Here we consider the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moiré superlattice emerging in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime. By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \\pm id_{xy} )$ and $p_y(p_{x}\\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of width three(four), respectively.",
