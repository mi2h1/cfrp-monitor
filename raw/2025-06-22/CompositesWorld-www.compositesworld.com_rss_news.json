Traditional VOC treatment methods are often costly and inefficient. Epcon says that its&nbsp;patented solution combines advanced oxidation technology with integrated heat recovery to reduce emissions while reducing energy costs.</p>\n\n<p>The custom system features a three-chamber RTO with more than 95% heat recovery efficiency, achieving 99%+ VOC destruction at temperatures up to 1600&deg;F. The oxidized exhaust is redirected through secondary and tertiary heat exchangers, repurposing waste heat to power curing ovens and preheat water used in adhesive processing.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Epcon&rsquo;s&nbsp;intelligent control system &mdash; powered by programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and variable frequency drives (VFDs) &mdash; ensures real-time adjustment of airflow, temperature&nbsp;and pressure, maintaining optimal curing conditions across varied production lines. With a 20:1 burner turndown ratio and precision software control, manufacturers can pre-define process parameters for consistent, automated operation.</p>\n\n<p>Through integration of air pollution control and process heating, the Epcon system significantly reduces natural gas and electricity consumption, lowers operating costs&nbsp;and ensures full compliance with air quality regulations.</p>"

It will enable automated manufacturing of composite parts, from fiber to fully inspected finished parts, for both commercial aerospace and defense applications, as well as other high-performance industries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With Fill&rsquo;s automation technology and NIAR&rsquo;s research depth, we&rsquo;re scaling our processes and tooling capabilities to meet rising demand across aerospace and defense,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Darrin Teeter, founder and CEO/CTO of Fiber Dynamics.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in Wichita more than&nbsp;34 years ago, Fiber Dynamics is recognized for its lost core tooling methodologies, which enable customers to manufacture integrated composite structures for flight control surfaces, propeller blades and other complex aerospace components in a single molding operation.</p>\n\n<p>In 2024, Fiber Dynamics partnered with Fill&nbsp;USA Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Fill&nbsp;GmbH, to help scale the company&rsquo;s novel manufacturing and tooling processes and deepen its investment in the U.S. market. Through work with NIAR&rsquo;s Advanced Technologies Lab for Aerospace Systems (ATLAS), Fill has already developed capabilities for the ultra high-rate manufacturing of thermoplastic composite structures. As the U.S. subsidiary&nbsp;continues to install systems in the U.S. market, it plans to expand its current brick-and-mortar presence and establish a U.S.-based Technology and Applications Center.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The collaboration between NIAR, Fiber Dynamics and Fill is a prime example of how local businesses can use the expertise and technology available at NIAR to broaden their scope and capabilities and compete in the global market,&rdquo; adds&nbsp;Dr. John Tomblin, WSU senior vice president for industry and defense programs, and executive director of NIAR.</p>\n\n<p>On June 12,&nbsp;a Kansas delegation visited Fill&rsquo;s Austrian headquarters ahead of the Paris Air Show, touring Fill&rsquo;s&nbsp;facility, learning&nbsp;about its&nbsp;workforce development model&nbsp;and demonstrating&nbsp;Wichita&rsquo;s commitment to global partnerships and economic growth.</p>"
