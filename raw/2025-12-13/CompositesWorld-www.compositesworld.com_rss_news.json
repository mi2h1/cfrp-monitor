Source | Cygnet Texkimp</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>A high-speed robotic winding machine developed by composites technology specialist <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/cygnet-texkimp\" target=\"_blank\">Cygnet Texkimp</a>&nbsp;(Northwich, U.K.) and the <a href=\"https://www.manchester.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Manchester</a> (U.K.) is being used to upgrade existing oil and gas pipelines in Canada.</p>\n\n<p>Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s Multi-Axis Winder has been commissioned by Canada-based pipeline technology company <a href=\"https://totalcontainment.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Total Containment Inc.</a> (TCI, Alberta)&nbsp;as part of a solution to wrap existing pipelines in carbon fiber&nbsp;in order to reduce the risk of leaks and enhance lifetime safety and performance.</p>\n\n<p>A research-scale model of the winder was delivered to TCI&rsquo;s&nbsp;headquarters in February 2025 to allow the company to produce and validate samples and further develop its methodology using its patented resin matrix. TCI subsequently&nbsp;commissioned a full-scale version of the technology which is now being built at Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s UK Innovation Centre and will be delivered to TCI in early 2026.</p>\n\n<p>TCI&rsquo;s solution has been developed to help oil and gas operators eliminate leaks and explosions by upgrading existing pipelines, many of which are two or three decades old. The technology helps operators meet new regulatory measures that require them to review and potentially adjust a pipeline&rsquo;s design and safety in order to protect people and the environment. It also addresses the challenge of equipping pipelines to transport oil and gas under higher pressures to improve operational efficiency. The solution replaces more common practices which rely on cutting out and replacing lengths of pipe, all of which is inherently&nbsp;slower and more expensive.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;By wrapping the pipeline in our proprietary carbon fiber composite sleeve, we are able to contain potential leaks and ruptures, and reduce the risk of explosion,&rdquo; explains TCI founder and CEO Larry Young. &ldquo;In this way, we&rsquo;re able to eliminate risk of ground and water contamination and its impact on ecosystems and communities, while simultaneously improving pipeline integrity, longevity and monitoring in high-risk areas. Our technology can also be installed without the need to shut down the pipeline&nbsp;by first reducing pressure to a safe operating level as per regulatory requirements for pipeline integrity digs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s Multi-Axis Winder was originally developed to wind large, continuous and curved parts, including pipes and structural beams,&nbsp;at speed, by laying down large volumes of fiber quickly and accurately around a static mandrel. Other applications include aircraft wing spars for aerospace and crash protection structures for automotive. It is a sister technology to the company&rsquo;s 3D Winder which is based on the same principles but is mounted onto a robot instead of a linear track to provide greater dexterity of winding geometry.</p>\n\n<p>The Multi-Axis Winder has been optimized primarily for throughput&nbsp;to enable manufacturers to create parts quickly and in high volumes. Both technologies were developed as part of a collaboration between Cygnet Texkimp and the University of Manchester and are based on a prototype from the University&rsquo;s School of Materials which was subsequently industrialized by Cygnet Texkimp in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>TCI&rsquo;s Multi-Axis Winder will be housed inside a purpose-designed modified shoring box called the &ldquo;TCI-Crawler.&rdquo; This is lowered into the pipeline trench to protect the pipeline, technology&nbsp;and operators while creating the preferred environment for executing winding. The fully electric machine will feature a 54-foot split winding ring that opens to allow for it to be installed around the static pipeline and pass along it, winding as it goes. The system has also been custom-designed to self-center&nbsp;and self-level the MAW on the pipeline during winding, and is capable of accommodating variations in pipeline geometry and ground topography.</p>"

UPR&rsquo;s engineering team said that&nbsp;the&nbsp;most significant challenge was&nbsp;adapting&nbsp;the&nbsp;production process without interrupting other ongoing projects. To&nbsp;achieve this, stages such&nbsp;as&nbsp;alignment&nbsp;and structural reinforcement of&nbsp;the&nbsp;megatank&nbsp;were divided into phases. This ensured operational safety&nbsp;and dimensional accuracy. In total,&nbsp;12 tonnes of raw materials were used.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the megatank&nbsp;required additional hot air post-curing to be adapted to food storage. It also included&nbsp;a&nbsp;hydrostatic test performed&nbsp;at&nbsp;UPR&rsquo;s facilities to control potential leaks.</p>\n\n<p>UPR considers&nbsp;the&nbsp;production of the megatank&nbsp;as a practical demonstration of its expertise. &ldquo;Manufacturing equipment of this size is a milestone for any composite producer,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Guilherme Loterio,&nbsp;UPR&rsquo;s&nbsp;industrial director. &ldquo;It shows&nbsp;that we master every process stage &mdash; from engineering to execution &mdash; meeting&nbsp;the&nbsp;highest technical standards.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>UPR offers a variety of products and services, including stationary tanks, transport tanks, pipes and fittings, assembly of FRP tanks and pipes and even anti-corrosion coating. Other successful projects have addressed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The sugar and ethanol sector: Supply of 56 30-square-meter GFRP tanks for Biosev; 44 30-square-meter GFRP tanks to Usina Cocal; and 106 vinasse transport tanks to&nbsp;Ra&iacute;zen.</li>\n\t<li>Chlorine soda plants: Supply of 20 stationary tanks (from 40-80 square meters) for the storage of&nbsp;&nbsp;ferric chloride, hydrochloric acid&nbsp;and sodium hypochlorite in a wide variety of concentrations.</li>\n\t<li>Sanitation: UPR has manufactured more than 200 GFRP tanks to companies like&nbsp;Sabesp, Sanepar and Casan.</li>\n\t<li>Chemical: The assembly of a liquid fertilizer plant for&nbsp;Ind&uacute;stria Mineira de Fertilizantes, supplying 23 storage tanks and ~500 meters of FRP pipes.</li>\n</ul>"

The initiative is part of the objectives of the European Green Deal, which aims for cleaner aviation with lower emissions by 2050.</p>\n\n<p>As a final validation of all of the project&rsquo;s developments, Aimen led the manufacture of a composite-reinforced epoxy outlet guide vane (OGV) demonstrator &mdash;&nbsp;a key component in aerospace turbines&nbsp;responsible for guiding airflow,&nbsp;contributing to engine efficiency and providing structural support for the engine to the aircraft body. The OGV&rsquo;s&nbsp;development combined automated dry carbon fiber&nbsp;lamination and resin transfer molding (RTM), processes in which a real-time quality control system was also integrated to prevent defects. This technological combination resulted in an OGV component that&nbsp;offers ~35% reduction in weight and up to 80% reduction in manufacturing defects,</p>\n\n<p>These results represent an important step toward&nbsp;the intelligent manufacture of aerospace composite structures, where automation, digitization and advanced materials combine to drive a more sustainable industry without compromising performance or safety.</p>\n\n<p>In recognition of its work, CAELESTIS has been selected as one of three finalists in the&nbsp;JEC World 2026 Innovation Awards in the &ldquo;Digital Manufacturing, AI &amp; Data&rdquo; category, an important awards in the field of composites worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>CAELESTIS is funded by the European Union and brings together partners specializing in aeronautics, advanced simulation, composites, automated manufacturing and digital technologies.&nbsp;</p>"
