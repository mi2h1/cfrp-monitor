The delivery of enhanced precision provides&nbsp;better game control and playability to players of all levels while reducing environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>Padel &mdash; also known as padel tennis&nbsp;&mdash; is currently one of the fastest-growing sports globally, with about 30 million active players in more than 140 countries around the world. Contributing to its popularity are its highly interactive and social nature, since it is generally played in doubles, making it accessible to people of all skill levels. Easy-to-use, stringless rackets made from composite materials with a perforated hitting surface is the main equipment used in this sport. Both companies believe that this exponential growth gives an&nbsp;opportunity to bring bio-based materials to the wider padel market.</p>\n\n<p>The launch of the GEA marks the inaugural racket series from Siux as a fully independent brand, a significant step in 2024 after its dissociation from Padel Nuestro. This launch underscores Siux&rsquo;s commitment to advancing padel as a sport through technical excellence and responsible design, setting the standard for the padel industry. With an energetic identity and playful feel, the GEA racket is engineered for precision, offering a broader optimized spot, enhanced power, and a medium touch that supports balanced, controlled gameplay.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of GEA&rsquo;s performance lies ampliTex&nbsp;flax fabrics, used on both the front and back of the racket. Developed by Bcomp, the natural fiber reinforcement offers optimal&nbsp;mechanical properties with minimal environmental impact. Moreover, the fibers&rsquo;s structure provides strong resistance to breakage, damping properties to reduce vibration for a better ball control, and a lightweight yet durable composition, ideal for high-performance sports equipment.</p>\n\n<p>Following the GEA padel, Siux plans to expand the use of natural fiber composites across its product lineup.&nbsp;&ldquo;As padel continues its rapid rise, we see a unique opportunity, and a responsibility, to lead with purpose,&rdquo; says Stefano Barbero, product director at Siux. &ldquo;With GEA, we set out to prove that performance and sustainability can go hand in hand. It&rsquo;s a reflection of our commitment to doing things differently: grounded in nature, driven by precision and built for the future of the sport.&rdquo;</p>"

CFRP Class A visible parts and structural components from ACE require milling of contours and trims prior to painting. For this purpose, the company uses&nbsp;three P-S-F (20-25)/S five-axis CNC portal milling machines from HG Grimme&nbsp;SysTech.</p>\n\n<p>ACE acquired the identical machining centers, each with two tables and a shuttle as well as a Siemens 840d sl control system, between 2016 and 2024. Consistent operation and machine tables with the same hole pattern and a fixed zero point also contribute to short setup times. Furthermore, ACE can postprocess the CFRP parts on all machines from HG Grimme&nbsp;SysTech interchangeably and without any quality limitations.</p>\n\n<p>The milling systems are suitable for workpieces with external dimensions of up to 2,000 &times; 2,500 &times;&nbsp;650 millimeters, which can be machined with optimal dynamics thanks to rapid traverse speeds of 80 meters/minute in X/U/Y axes and 30 meters/minute in the Z-axis.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-ace-automotive-components.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Visible car parts on display.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-ace-automotive-components.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Around two-thirds of the components and assemblies made from CFRP are visible parts, mainly for car bodies, in particular wings and bonnets.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Double tables and shuttles result in a machine length of just under 11 meters and a width of slightly less than 6&nbsp;meters. This simultaneously provides sufficient space for good accessibility to the machine table and milling head from all sides.</p>\n\n<p>The components to be machined are up to 2,000 &times;&nbsp;2,500 millimeters in size, with thicknesses between 1 and 3 millimeters, and batch sizes usually vary between 500 and 10,000 pieces.</p>\n\n<p>Around two-thirds of the products are visible parts, predominantly for car bodies, particularly fenders and hoods. The remaining parts are structural components such as monocoques for the drivetrain, battery trays for electric vehicles, and paneling for B-pillars and center struts.</p>\n\n<p>Given the significant dust generation during CFRP milling, CNC machining centers from HG Grimme SysTech are completely encased, and an extraction system removes many airborne particles directly within the enclosure. Furthermore, the components are manually cleaned again with high pressure after machining.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-hg-grimme-cnc-machining.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"Shuttle system.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-hg-grimme-cnc-machining.jpeg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>The shuttle system with two tables reduces downtime of the milling centers to 2-3% of the machine running time &mdash;&nbsp;compared to 40-45% for a system with only one table.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;HG Grimme understands something about processing composite materials, and the communication is at eye level,&rdquo; says Peter Klaus Gr&ouml;schl, production manager and one of the managing directors of ACE. &ldquo;The company is down-to-earth. We enjoy working together.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>ACE manufactures 90% of its CFRP components and assemblies using closed resin transfer molding (RTM). In this process, textile preforms are cut and prepared into layups, which are then placed in presses, injected with resin, and cured into shells. The edges of the two, or less frequently three, shells still need to be milled before they are subsequently bonded together to form the carbon fiber part.</p>\n\n<p>After contour and trim milling, the bonded and painted components are inspected before ACE delivers them to its customers' assembly lines. This includes well-known brands such as Lamborghini, Porsche, Aston Martin, Bugatti, BMW, Mercedes, AMG, Audi, and Volkswagen. The most important customers from the aerospace industry are Airbus and Boeing.</p>"

This decentralized drivetrain architecture has the potential to enhance vehicle dynamics and improve system efficiency, positioning the team to compete at a higher level as it prepares for international competitions.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve these goals, Team Kratos is welcoming a sponsored partner who may be willing to contribute to this hub motor project.&nbsp;In return, the team&nbsp;offers the same benefits as the year prior: Substantial exposure through car branding, team uniforms, promotional materials&nbsp;and social media. This partnership would highlight the sponsoring company&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and quality in front of a dedicated audience.&nbsp;Additionally, the&nbsp;team can provide an 80G certificate, enabling sponsors to avail themselves of CSR benefits.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As the level of competition intensifies, the need for cutting-edge innovation and advanced technologies becomes greater than ever,&rdquo; says Upendra Patil, mechanical chief technical officer for&nbsp;Team Kratos Racing Electric. &ldquo;To continue pushing boundaries &mdash; from integrating hub motors to building a<br />\none-piece monocoque &mdash; we rely not just on talent, but also on vital<br />\nmonetary support.

This includes underground pipelines, hydrogen production plants and storage facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Phase one of HyNet is designed to store 109 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in the East Irish Sea over 25 years &mdash;&nbsp;the equivalent of taking 60.1 million cars off the road for a year.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>HyNet&rsquo;s use of hydrogen and&nbsp;CCUS technologies like underground pipes could have large implications for robust and effective composite solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Thermoplastic composite pipes (TCP) emerged in the oil and gas industry in the 1990s thanks to their noncorrosive and high-strength nature in both onshore and offshore environments.</p>\n\n<p>Today, TCP is being considered and developed for hydrogen solutions.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/thermoplastic-composite-pipes-provide-59-reduction-in-h2-distribution-co2-emissions\" target=\"_blank\">Hive Composites&rsquo; multilayer design</a> &mdash; validated for 30-plus years of service life, offering 59% CO<sub>2</sub> reduction versus steel and 40-times faster installation rates&nbsp;&mdash; could have high potential for projects like HyNet.

They were issued alongside the economic license awarded by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon storage is a vital cog in the U.K.&rsquo;s clean energy future and the NSTA is playing a major role in ensuring the sector reaches its full potential. The NSTA awarded its first-ever carbon storage permit to the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) for a site in the Southern North Sea in December 2024. The regulator also launched a large-scale carbon storage licensing round in 2022, resulting in <a href=\"https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/news-publications/net-zero-boost-as-carbon-storage-licences-accepted/\" target=\"_blank\">21 awards the following year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>HyNet will be served by a combination of new infrastructure and existing infrastructure which will be repurposed for carbon transportation and storage. In total, more than 90 miles of offshore and onshore pipeline will be given a new lease of life, delivering substantial cost savings and cutting the environmental impact associated with the construction, transportation and installation of new kit.</p>\n\n<p>A new platform will be installed at the Douglas field to receive CO<sub>2</sub> from the Point of Ayr Gas Terminal in Flintshire, Wales. From there, the CO<sub>2 </sub>will be transported onward to the Hamilton, Hamilton North and Lennox depleted oil and gas reservoirs operated by Eni in Liverpool Bay, for permanent storage.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the North Sea, we have one of the greatest carbon storage potentials of any country,&rdquo; says energy secretary Ed Miliband.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>What is carbon storage?</h3>\n\n<p>Carbon storage facilities have been operating across the world for decades. The process involves capturing emissions before they reach the atmosphere and transporting them to depleted reservoirs or aquifers for permanent storage.</p>\n\n<p>As well as playing an important role in decarbonizing the economy, the carbon storage industry will provide a bridge to help oil and gas workers transfer their skills to clean-energy jobs, supporting communities and anchoring the supply chain in the U.K.</p>\n</div>"
