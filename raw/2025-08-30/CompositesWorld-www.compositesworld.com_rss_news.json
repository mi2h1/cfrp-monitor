Stability and performance are further optimized through variable wall thickness &mdash;&nbsp;7.5 millimeters at the bottom for a low center of gravity, tapering to 5.5 millimeters at the top to reduce weight. This gradient improves both balance and material efficiency.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n<p>Advanced active layer time management was employed throughout printing.

Toward this goal, the Pays de la Loire region is granting &euro;500,000 in financial aid, representing one-third of the project&rsquo;s total budget.</p>\n\n<p>The project&rsquo;s first phase (ODDICEA 1, conducted from 2018-2023) enabled Daher to take a major leap forward in Industry 4.0. Co-funded at 40% by the Pays de la Loire region, ODDICEA enabled the company to move from a robotic plant to a connected factory, delivering tangible results: a 10% increase in productivity at connected workstations; energy savings of approximately &euro;10,000 per month; and a 10% reduction in CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions.&nbsp;These results received recognition, notably with the &ldquo;Digital Revolution&rdquo; award at the 2023 Future Enterprise Heroes Ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>The project also strengthened Daher&rsquo;s integration into the local ecosystem through collaboration with organizations such as IRT Jules Verne, an industrial and collaborative research center for manufacturing; and Astree Software, a key partner in the implementation of manufacturing execution systems (MES).</p>\n\n<p>With continued backing, ODDICEA 2 builds on the achievements of the program&rsquo;s first phase, further improving the Daher Nantes site&rsquo;s performance while reducing its carbon footprint. This new phase continues the work of ODDICEA 1, with the internally developed connectivity standard serving as the foundation.</p>\n\n<p>ODDICEA 2 is structured around four main pillars. The first focuses on optimizing energy consumption through a real-time monitoring solution, along with efforts to eliminate carbon-based energy sources from the plant&rsquo;s energy mix. The goal of the remaining three pillars is to enhance the use of industrial data and integrate advanced technologies to increase the site&rsquo;s competitiveness. ODDICEA 2 also will benefit other Daher sites, with methods and tools that can be rolled out group-wide.</p>"

The achievement builds on Joby&rsquo;s momentum toward&nbsp;commercial market readiness, acting as a&nbsp;critical measure of the company&rsquo;s product maturity, as well as demonstrating&nbsp;the type of real-world service Joby intends to offer to the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Joby&rsquo;s flight time from OAR to MRY was approximately 12 minutes over 10 nautical miles, including 5 minutes in a hold pattern at MRY for air traffic spacing. The piloted flight included vertical takeoff, transition to wingborne flight, integration into the controlled airspace around MRY&nbsp;and vertical landing. The milestone marks the first time a piloted Joby eVTOL&nbsp;air taxi has flown from one public airport to another. The flight also successfully demonstrated the team&rsquo;s ability to conduct mobile flight tests and deliver full ground support operations away from home base in Marina.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For years, our flight testing has validated our aircraft&rsquo;s capabilities, and we&rsquo;ve done this across a wide range of environmental conditions,&rdquo; notes Didier Papadopoulos, president of aircraft OEM at Joby. &ldquo;As part of the natural progression of our flight test program, it was time to venture further.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These critical flight tests also provided developmental data related to the human factors of operating the aircraft at a controlled airport and in the enroute national airspace. In particular, Joby&rsquo;s ability to integrate into controlled airspace was demonstrated when its aircraft successfully sequenced with other aircraft at Monterey Airport, including a holding pattern to accommodate another arriving airliner. This is also an important step in the company&rsquo;s certification efforts, as the FAA requires aircraft to demonstrate they can operate in shared airspace by flying between multiple airports.</p>\n\n<p>Video of the flight demonstration can be viewed below.</p>\n\n<div></div>"

It likely incorporates composite materials, as the <a href=\"https://evtol.news/ehang-vt30#:~:text=The%20EHang%20VT%2D30%20an,fly%20people%20between%20two%20cities.\" target=\"_blank\">VT30 prototype</a>&rsquo;s superstructure was carbon fiber composite. EHang and the Hefei government&nbsp;plan to jointly invest in and establish a comprehensive base for VT35 series products in Hefei, covering R&amp;D, testing, manufacturing, airworthiness certification, supply chain management, sales, operations&nbsp;and talent development.</p>\n\n<p>This partnership represents a significant upgrade in EHang&rsquo;s strategic layout at its East China regional headquarters in Hefei and accelerates industrialization of the VT35 series. The total investment in this partnership is estimated to be approximately RMB 1 billion (approx. $139.8 million). In addition, the Hefei government plans to provide EHang with comprehensive support valued at approximately RMB 500 million (approx. $70 million), including orders for eVTOL aircraft, investments&nbsp;or other forms of cooperation across the industry chain.</p>\n\n<p>The VT35 is designed for medium- to long-distance air mobility, including intercity, cross-sea&nbsp;and cross-mountain transport. It introduces major upgrades from the VT30 such as advanced autonomous flight control and propulsion systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>EHang&rsquo;s&nbsp;type certificate (TC) application for the VT35 was officially accepted by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAA&rdquo;) in February 2025 and is currently under airworthiness review process. EHang&rsquo;s goals are to achieve TC,&nbsp;production certificate (PC)&nbsp;and standard airworthiness certification (AC). Further, the company will assist its joint venture, Hefei Heyi Aviation Co.&nbsp;Ltd., in applying for air operator certification (OC) for the VT35. These efforts will enable a wide range of operations &mdash; including urban and intercity passenger transport, logistics&nbsp;and emergency rescue in Hefei and the broader East China region.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, EHang has worked closely with Hefei, achieving growth together and making significant contributions to the city&rsquo;s low-altitude economy.&nbsp;Gaoyun Fei, secretary of the CPC Hefei Municipal Committee, has expressed&nbsp;hope that EHang will continue to grow in Hefei;&nbsp;strengthen cooperation with universities, research institutions and leading companies; and help bring more advanced technologies to the city. He also encouraged EHang to attract more high-quality projects, expand into areas such as logistics, fire protection&nbsp;and tourism, and work together to improve the low-altitude economy&rsquo;s industrial ecosystem.</p>"

Source | Dassault&nbsp;Syst&egrave;mes</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Back in November 2023, Australia&rsquo;s&nbsp;iLAuNCH Trailblazer program &mdash;&nbsp;which aims to address critical skill gaps and accelerate the development of Australia&rsquo;s space sector&nbsp;&mdash; announced its backing of a&nbsp;University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) project, targeting faster and more efficient&nbsp;aircraft and spacecraft composite repairs. Supported by Boeing Australia and&nbsp;engineering services company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://memko.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Memko</a> (Melbourne), the university&rsquo;s&nbsp;Centre for Future Materials (CFM) has since innovated a digital twin using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/dassault-sys\" target=\"_blank\">Dassault Syst&egrave;mes</a>&rsquo; (V&eacute;lizy-Villacoublay, France) 3DEXPERIENCE platform to&nbsp;digitize&nbsp;the composite repair process.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;MEMKO brings to UniSQ access to the Dassault Syst&egrave;mes virtual twin software and their engineering expertise with these tools, which enables the virtual replication of a product along its whole life cycle &mdash;&nbsp;from digital design through to manufacturing requirements or in this case, structural repair,&rdquo; says&nbsp;iLAuNCH Trailblazer executive director Darin Lovett.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Tristan Shelley from the UniSQ CFM has been heading the research, with the ultimate goal of increasing the digitalization of manufacturing processes for composite materials. In addition, to complete the project, the&nbsp;UniSQ installed scholarships for three Ph.D. opportunities to work alongside engineers and scientists at Boeing Aerostructures Australia and Memko in Melbourne, Brisbane and Toowoomba in an effort to develop workforce development and upskilling programs.</p>\n\n<p>Almost two years later, the&nbsp;iLAuNCH Trailblazer project&nbsp;has seen much success, which&nbsp;Dassault Syst&egrave;mes&nbsp;has detailed in this customer story <a href=\"https://www.3ds.com/insights/customer-stories/university-southern-queensland-composite-material-repair\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Using the 3DEXPERIENCE platform&rsquo;s digital twin capabilities, Shelley and his team have been doing everything from damage detection and capturing real-time visual data from filament winding to&nbsp;predict and optimize the best wind path, to&nbsp;programming scarfing tool paths, all in the name of&nbsp;eliminating&nbsp;both engineering and laborious processes and creating greater precision in the composite repair process.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are refining the NDT [nondestructive testing] process to help engineers identify the repairs area faster and more precisely,&rdquo; Shelley says in the article. &ldquo;We use reverse engineering capabilities within the&nbsp;3DEXPERIENCE platform to read the processed NDT data. This enables the creation of topology (the properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations) which in turn can be overlaid with actual CAD data. This allows us to analyze and improve the visibility of internal layers to identify the size and extent of the damage.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.3ds.com/insights/customer-stories/university-southern-queensland-composite-material-repair\" target=\"_blank\">Read the original article</a> for more details about the project&rsquo;s process, successes and next steps.</p>"

Source | FACC Bartsch</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In the first half of 2025,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facc.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">FACC</a>&nbsp;(Ried im Innkreis, Austria) reports it was able to achieve a&nbsp;10.6% increase in revenue to &euro;484.7 million (same period in 2024: &euro;438.3 million) despite a still challenging global environment.</p>\n\n<p>All divisions of FACC (Aerostructures, Cabin Interiors, and Engines and Nacelles)&nbsp;reported a positive EBIT in the first half of 2025. Group EBIT of &euro;18.4 million is in line with management's expectations and is burdened by disruptions in international supply chains as well as high material and personnel costs (same period in 2024: &euro;22.5 million). Compared to the previous year, the number of employees increased by 123 employees (FTE).</p>\n\n<p>Overall, growth of the aviation industry continued in the first half of the year. While short-term adjustments took place in the market for passenger aircraft &mdash; which were affected by supply chain problems in the engine sector&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;FACC was able to benefit from the sustained positive development of the business jet market in part due to the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;diverse product strategy. The long-term growth of the whole industry is illustrated by a worldwide record order backlog of more than&nbsp;17,500 passenger aircraft ordered. This is also reflected in FACC&rsquo;s order backlog, which rose to more than $6 billion in the first half of 2025 with new orders and rate increases.</p>\n\n<p>FACC&rsquo;s&nbsp;global production and sales network of 15 international locations in Europe, the U.S. and Asia provides it with a high level of resilience given the current geopolitical challenges. With the strengthening of the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/facc-agreements-with-rolls-royce-tata-and-kineco-expand-its-global-backlog-footprint-in-india-\" target=\"_blank\">supply chain in India</a>, relocation of production of the COMAC C919 product range (structural and interior systems) to China, and an increase in operating performance at the FACC plants in Croatia/Jakovlje and in Canada/Montreal, this location strategy could be further advanced in the first half of 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The company&rsquo;s cost reduction and efficiency program, which has been in place since October 2024, is already showing results. This is illustrated by FACC&rsquo;s increase in revenue with around the same&nbsp;number of employees since the end of FACC&rsquo;s&nbsp;2024 financial year. In addition, the focus in the first half of 2025 was on optimizing the supply chain and reducing material inventories. These have been significantly reduced since the end of Q3 2024, thereby contributing to an improvement in cash flow.</p>\n\n<p>When considering its outlook for the duration of 2025, FACC expects to see around&nbsp;5 billion passengers in the aerospace industry&nbsp;for the first time. Airlines&rsquo; demand for efficient and modern aircraft remains high, and despite ongoing supply chain challenges, all major aircraft manufacturers are confirming their targets for the entire 2025 financial year at the end of the first half of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the current market situation for 2025, FACC management expects growth to continue and has specified its outlook at the half-year mark at around &euro;1 billion in group revenue, which corresponds to a revenue growth of more than 10% compared to the previous year. The EBIT margin will continue to improve compared to 2024 due to effects from FACC&rsquo;s efficiency improvement program currently being implemented (2024: 3.2%).</p>"
