More than 43,000 satellites are expected to be launched by 2035 &mdash; an average of 12 satellites and 8 tons of payload every day. This surge is set to drive a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services, fueled by mega-constellations, defense demand and rapid innovation in launch technology.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing a rapid expansion in satellite activity and a shift in how space is used,&rdquo; says Gabriel Deville, manager at Novaspace. &ldquo;Satellites are no longer just custom-built assets, they&rsquo;re evolving into interconnected nodes within decentralized networks. This marks a new chapter in orbital complexity and global connectivity.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-novaspace-satellites-by-year2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Novaspace data in 2025 edition Satellites to Be Built and Launched report\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-novaspace-satellites-by-year2.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Source | Novaspace</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Five mega-constellations will account for 66% of satellites launched between 2025 and 2034 yet contribute just 11% of total market value. The rise of such non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) systems and the shift away from legacy geostationary/ geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) models has largely been fueled by Starlink&rsquo;s demonstration of scalability and flexibility. Budget priorities, meanwhile, sits with defense. Defense remains the market&rsquo;s economic anchor, capturing 48% of total value despite representing just 9% of satellite volume.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Read about composites in launchers and satellites:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composites-end-markets-new-space-(2025)\" target=\"_blank\">Composites end markets: New space (2025)</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/revolutionizing-space-composites-a-new-era-of-satellite-materials\" target=\"_blank\">Revolutionizing space composites: A new era of satellite materials</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ultra-thin-woven-fabric-enables-90-resource-reduction-in-satellite-solar-array-manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\">Ultra-thin woven fabric enables 90% resource reduction in satellite solar array manufacturing</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/low-cost-efficient-cfrp-anisogrid-lattice-structures-\" target=\"_blank\">Low-cost, efficient CFRP anisogrid lattice structures</a><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--></a><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CFRP anisogrid lattice structure for the Vega-C interstage 2/3\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Source | CIRA&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Looking to the launch market, the space transportation sector remains under bottleneck, with SpaceX enjoying a near-monopoly over heavy launch activity in the West.

Source | Deutsche Bahn AG/Volker Emersleben</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>A&nbsp;multi-award-winning infrastructure project, the&nbsp;Oder Bridge near K&uuml;strin, Poland, is supported by a 130-meter-long network arch with prestressed carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tension members&nbsp;developed by Empa spin-off <a href=\"https://www.carbo-link.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carbo-Link</a> (Fehraltorf, Switzerland)&nbsp;and tested and evaluated by <a href=\"https://empa.ch/\" target=\"_blank\">Empa</a>&nbsp;(D&uuml;bendorf), the&nbsp;Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. Eighty-eight ultra-lightweight,&nbsp;durable CFRP cables&nbsp;stabilize the filigree construction over the Oder River.</p>\n\n<p>The railway bridge over the Oder is a double-track network arch bridge. Although&nbsp;such CFRP&nbsp;cables have already been used on another bridge, this is the first time they have been used worldwide for heavy rail freight traffic; trains&nbsp;can now pass over the structure at speeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour &mdash; which required extensive testing and complex approval procedures. The bridge received&nbsp;two awards for its design &mdash;&nbsp;the British Bridges International Award and the German Bridge Construction Prize.</p>\n\n<p>According to the jury of the German Bridge Construction Prize, the K&uuml;strin Oder Bridge is not only considered an engineering masterpiece but is also &ldquo;pioneering in terms of economy and sustainability.&rdquo; The 88 carbon hangers significantly reduce the weight compared to conventional flat steel hangers due to CFRP&rsquo;s high tensile strength and optimal fatigue resistance. This opens up new design freedoms, as the airy, transparent appearance of the Oder Bridge demonstrates. In addition, the material savings reduce construction costs and maintenance requirements in the long term.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-OderBridge-CFRP-hangar-testing.jfif\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"CFRP hangar testing.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-OderBridge-CFRP-hangar-testing.jfif;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Hangers made of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) tested at Empa provide strength and sustainability. Source | Empa</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Overall, the use of CFRP hangers saved around 500 tons of steel and 1,350 tons of reinforced concrete in the bridge&rsquo;s overall structure. A sustainability study by Urs Meier, CFRP pioneer and former member of Empa&rsquo;s Directorate, shows that the composite version saves around 20%&nbsp;CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions compared to a steel structure.</p>\n\n<p>According to Lorenz Haspel, the project manager responsible at engineering firm schlaich bergermann partner (sbp, Stuttgart, Germany), the CFRP bridge would not have been possible without Empa.&nbsp;&ldquo;The innovative CFRP hangers come from the Empa spin-off Carbo-Link in Fehraltorf &mdash;&nbsp;founded by Andreas Winist&ouml;rfer, CEO and former Empa doctoral student &ndash;&mdash;and have now been used for the second time in a network arch bridge,&rdquo; says Haspel. &ldquo;We used such carbon [fiber] cables for the first time as highly stressed tension members in a network arch on the city railway bridge in Stuttgart.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The fatigue tests for the Oder bridge were largely carried out by a team from Empa&rsquo;s Structural Engineering lab led by Robert Widmann and Dimitri Ott in Empa&rsquo;s construction hall,&nbsp;confirming the necessary fatigue strength of the CFRP material. Giovanni Terrasi, head of Empa&rsquo;s Mechanical Systems Engineering lab, also worked with Christian Affolter to prepare the technical report for the bridge. &ldquo;We have laid the foundation for a new generation of filigree network arch bridges with carbon [fiber] hangers as load-bearing elements,&rdquo; Terrasi believes.</p>"

At the end of September 2025, the Azerbaijan Grand Prix saw the debut of this bio-based carbon fiber&nbsp;composite material &mdash; rear brake duct wheel shields which were developed using a novel&nbsp;resin that includes 30% bio-based materials.</p>\n\n<p>This marked the the first time the team used this kind of material on a&nbsp;technically performant component in race conditions. Applying these materials to the rear brake duct wheel shields &mdash; with their intricate aerodynamic surfaces&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;demonstrates the technology can withstand the extreme conditions of Formula One racing, and supports its potential for widespread adoption across the sport.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This project with <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/solvay-composite-materials\" target=\"_blank\">Syensqo</a>&nbsp;[Brussels, Belgium and Alpharetta, Ga., U.S.] highlights&nbsp;our commitment to reduce our environmental impact while maintaining the highest standards of performance,&rdquo; says Alice Ashpitel, head of sustainability.&nbsp;&ldquo;The fact that these materials have been derived from byproducts associated with the creation of bio-diesel is an added benefit and indicates the power of advanced sustainable fuels.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Syensqo&rsquo;s bio-based resin technology supported the W16 race car project. &ldquo;By replacing&nbsp;traditional petroleum-based components with those derived from renewable sources, we are not only introducing circularity in our product design but also paving the way for future innovations,&rdquo; notes&nbsp;Rodrigo Elizondo, president of Syensqo Composite Materials.</p>"

The proposed closures are the direct result of crippling energy and carbon costs, and a lack of tariff protection. The intention to close, which has been shared with employees, reflects a deepening crisis across Europe&rsquo;s chemical sector.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;While competitors in the U.S. and China benefit from cheap energy, European producers are being priced out by our own policies and absence of tariff protection,&rdquo; notes Stephen Dossett, CEO of INEOS Inovyn, the company&rsquo;s chlorvinyls and&nbsp;specialty PVC producer. These chemicals can be used in the production of fiber-reinforced composite materials.&nbsp;&ldquo;Meanwhile, high-emission imports flood our market unchecked. It&rsquo;s completely unsustainable and if not immediately addressed will lead to further closures, job losses and increased dependency on other regions for essential materials.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Both plants produce essential chemicals. The Allylics unit makes the key ingredient for epoxy resins vital in defense, aerospace, cars and renewable energy infrastructure. The electrochemical facility produces chlorine crucial for clean water, medicines, industrial processes and sanitation.</p>\n\n<p>These closures are part of a wider trend as Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness collapses, INEOS points out. Since 2019, output in Germany has dropped by 18%, driving job losses and reduced investment. INEOS has closed plants in Grangemouth (U.K.) and Geel (Belgium). It is closing Gladbeck (Germany), and has mothballed assets in Tavaux (France) and Martorell (Spain).</p>\n\n<p>INEOS will now focus on preserving its remaining PVC operations in Rheinberg to support around 300 skilled jobs. This requires urgent state support to help cover significant local transitioning costs.</p>\n\n<p>The business deeply regrets the decision to close Rheinberg&rsquo;s cell rooms and Allylics operations, and is conscious of the impact it will have on staff and wider German supply chain. &ldquo;INEOS Inovyn will work closely with partners and employees to minimize the impact.&rdquo; says&nbsp;Dossett &ldquo;We are doing everything we can to protect what is still viable, but we can&rsquo;t do it alone. If governments want to keep strategic manufacturing in Europe, they must help manage this transition and restore competitiveness.&rdquo;</p>"
