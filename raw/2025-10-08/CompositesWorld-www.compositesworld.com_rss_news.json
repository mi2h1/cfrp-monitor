Source | Advanced Composites Solutions Srl (ACS)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Exploring the application prospects of biocomposites in industry, and highlighting the strategic role that research and innovation can play in their development.&nbsp;This was&nbsp;the goal behind&nbsp;the final seminar of the MAGISTRA (Next Generation Innovative Sustainable Technological Recyclable Advanced Composite Materials) project, promoted by <a href=\"https://www.acs-carbon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Composites Solutions Srl</a> (ACS, Tortoreto, Italy)&nbsp;and funded with the support of the Abruzzo Region under the Abruzzo ERDF Regional Program 2021-2027.</p>\n\n<p>The initiative, under the patronage of the Confindustria Abruzzo Medio Adriatico Association, aimed&nbsp;to present the results achieved by the project, which ACS carried out in collaboration with the University of Catania (Italy) through a research pathway focused on biocomposites. These are composite materials in which at least one of the two main components &mdash;&nbsp;matrix or reinforcement &mdash;&nbsp;comes from renewable, natural&nbsp;or recycled sources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The final MAGISTRA project seminar took place at ACS&rsquo;&nbsp;new plant in Tortoreto (Teramo).&nbsp;After the opening remarks by Paolo Battista, LEAN systems designer and HR&nbsp;director of ACS, contributions followed from Fabio Fazzini and Romualdo Paino of the ACS technical department, who illustrated the manufacturing process of biocomposites and their integration using out-of-autoclave&nbsp;techniques. This dialogue was followed by Gianluca Cicala, professor of materials science and technology and deputy director of the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture (DICAR)&nbsp;at the University of Catania, recently elected president of the Italian Association of Materials Engineering (AIMAT). His contribution, delivered online, focused on the role of research in the development of biocomposites and on the added value that the MAGISTRA project represents&nbsp;for industry.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the presentations, a debate and discussion with the audience took place, followed by concluding remarks.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the MAGISTRA project we confirmed our commitment to sustainable innovation,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Roberto Catenaro, CEO of ACS. &ldquo;Biocomposites represent a bridge between academic research and concrete industrial applications, capable of combining technological performance and environmental responsibility. We are proud to have contributed to building more competitive and sustainable value chains.&rdquo;</p>"

This method significantly reduced&nbsp;the shipyard&rsquo;s scope of work and kept installation&nbsp;time short. For this installation, it took only 1.5 days to lift and fix the rotor sails in position onboard, with a further 5 days for commissioning and testing all four rotor sails and folding systems once the shipyard had completed their work&nbsp;during the vessel&rsquo;s scheduled dry-dock in September 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Anemoi&rsquo;s specialist team were present throughout the process, overseeing the installation, and will sail on the vessel&rsquo;s maiden voyage from Zhoushan to Singapore, with the rotor sails deployed and operational.

Within that category, lightning damage is the largest cost center, with more than $255.7 million in repairs being undertaken in 2025. This&nbsp;is expected to escalate to more than $333 million by the end of 2034.</p>\n\n<p>Blade root failures are now the second most expensive repair for wind turbines, with more than $222.3 million in annual costs, InstelStore finds. Root insert separation is a well-known issue on certain makes and models of wind turbines, and is contributing to the cost spike for blades due to the requirement to call out a large crane for safety to remove and replace a blade with such damage.</p>\n\n<p>Pitch bearing repairs are the next most expensive category, with more than $190.9 million. Despite the fact that up-tower repairs can be made with segmented components, some machines do not have a crane-less solution for certain repairs, particularly when a full bearing swap is required.</p>\n\n<p>Making pitch bearings repairs, as well as yaw bearing or any gearbox and generator repairs fully in situ, is one of IntelStor&rsquo;s top 30 onshore wind technology trends. As for the generators, the consistency of bearings failures &mdash; brought on in part by stray currents&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;has resulted in an escalation in costs over the years for this category of repairs, a total of $190.6 million.</p>\n\n<p>Yaw bearing repairs, including slewing ring replacements, constitute more than 10%&nbsp;of total annual repair costs. As noted before, the need for a full crane call-out to lift the nacelle to perform repairs or remove bearings to the ground, continues to make turbine repairs expensive overall, and the yaw systems in particular are still a significant expense.</p>\n\n<p>IntelStore notes that&nbsp;turbines with a nameplate capacity of 1-2 megawatts (MW)&nbsp;are no longer the largest contributor to the overall repair cost breakdown at 33.1%. Rather, it is 2-3-MW turbines, which are now 52.5% of the total annual expenditure. Based on 2025 installed base data, for 1-2-MW turbines, lightning damage is the number one issue, while&nbsp;2-3-MW class blades primarily have issues with root insert failures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While IntelStore expects lightning damage to overtake root issues in the coming years for 2-3-MW wind turbines, this still underscores how impactful any repairs which necessitate significant downtime or require a crane call-out can be for an asset owner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To learn more, InstelStor offers a <a href=\"https://www.intelstor.com/store/Research-Notes-Subscription-p127663810\" target=\"_blank\">Research Notes subscription</a>.</p>"

Updates also bring automated data capture and processing, improving data quality and consistency across all testing phases &mdash;&nbsp;enabling engineers to test faster, smarter and earlier.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Modal analysis in composites</h3>\n\n<p>Modal analysis identifies a structure&rsquo;s natural vibration characteristics, including natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping factors. These properties define how a structure responds to dynamic loads and is becoming more time-consuming as composites grow in complexity and use for defense, aviation, space, future mobility and civil engineering applications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Modal analysis typically comprises finite element models (FEM) and other simulation as well as experimental tests for verification. Simcenter Testlab is being used to aid this process for <strong>composite wind turbine blades</strong> and<strong> aircraft fuselage panels</strong>, among other applications.</p>\n\n<p>To better understand AI-assisted modal analysis, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/ai-assisted-modal-analysis-simcenter-testlab-2506/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/simcenter/ai-assisted-modal-analysis-simcenter-testlab-2506/\">Experience AI-assisted modal analysis with Simcenter Testlab 2506 - Simcenter</a>&rdquo;&nbsp;which includes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/24TUC9eYjcY\" target=\"_blank\">this video</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Siemens is&nbsp;leveraging AI to streamline processes and workflows, minimize manual tasks and accelerate time to market throughout the engineering life cycle, says Jean-Claude Ercolanelli, senior vice president, simulation and test solutions for Siemens Digital Industries Software. &ldquo;The latest enhancements in Simcenter Testlab illustrate our approach to integrating AI to transform how teams conduct, manage and interpret physical testing.

This decision&nbsp;follows a thorough review of Boeing&rsquo;s ongoing production quality and will enable the FAA&rsquo;s&nbsp;inspectors to focus additional surveillance in the production process. The FAA will continue to maintain direct and rigorous oversight of Boeing's production processes. Boeing and the FAA will issue airworthiness certificates on alternating weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The FAA&rsquo;s&nbsp;Organization Designation Authorization (ODA)&nbsp;program allows authorized organizations to perform certification functions on behalf of the FAA, such as issuing airworthiness and production certifications for aircraft. In May, the FAA&nbsp;renewed Boeing&rsquo;s Organization Designation Authorization (ODA)&nbsp;for 3 years effective June 1, 2025. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Resuming limited delegation to the Boeing ODA will enable FAA inspectors to provide additional surveillance in the production process. For example, there will be more FAA inspectors observing critical assembly stages, examining trends, ensuring Boeing mechanics are performing work to approved type design and engineering requirements, and assessing all activities for Boeing&rsquo;s continuous improvement of its Safety Management System (SMS). Inspectors will also observe Boeing&rsquo;s safety culture, ensuring that Boeing employees can report safety issues without fear of retribution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The FAA stopped allowing Boeing to issue airworthiness certificates for 737 <em>Max&nbsp;</em>airplanes in 2019 during its return to service following the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, and for Boeing 787 airplanes in 2022 because of production quality issues.&nbsp;</p>"

Moore. Source |&nbsp;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>To avoid their disposal in landfills or recycling in high-energy, low-value industrial processes, scientists globally are developing ways to manufacture&nbsp; carbon fiber-reinforced polymer&nbsp;(CFRP) materials that allow for triggered deconstruction and&nbsp;the recovery of high-quality carbon at the end of their life span. But this promising alternative still creates a waste stream of material with little value, notes researchers at the <a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, who are exploring an innovative method using a renewable energy source to upcycle this leftover material.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry professor Jeffrey S. Moore, and postdoctoral researchers Yuting Zhou and Zhenchuang Xu, report in their recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-025-00876-7\" target=\"_blank\">published paper</a>&nbsp;a method&nbsp;that uses electricity to modify this recycling byproduct in a way that converts it to useful material. &ldquo;This closes a critical loop in the life cycle of carbon fiber composites,&rdquo; Moore says. The research team&rsquo;s modification of this byproduct happens at the molecular level through electrolysis, a process using electric current to drive a chemical reaction in a solution.</p>\n\n<p>The recycling byproducts are basically fragments of the original material &mdash; CFRP &mdash; consisting of molecules known as oligomers, smaller chains of repeating monomer units. CFRP&nbsp;consists of cross-linked polymer matrices and carbon fiber, or networks of polymer chains that reinforce the carbon fibers. By comparison, thermoplastics consist&nbsp;of linear polymers, long chains with many repeating monomer units.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In deconstructing CFRP&nbsp;to recover the fibers, the polymer matrix is broken and leaves behind the waste fragments consisting of oligomers with low mechanical properties, Zhou explains. But through electrolysis, the researchers directly modify the oligomer backbone &mdash;&nbsp;the main structure of the polymer chain &mdash;&nbsp;at two different locations. In a single step, they modify the chain by installing two key functional groups at two carbon-hydrogen bond sites, which enables the modified oligomers to assemble into a new network formation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Those installed functional groups can link together, so we can link the fragments into a network,&rdquo; says Zhou. &ldquo;The goal is to link them [oligomers] back into a network and then restore the mechanical performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In this novel&nbsp;dynamic network form, known as covalently adaptable networks (CANS), this polymer material again has strong mechanical properties and the ability to be reprocessed.&nbsp;&ldquo;The practical significance is that we can now take low-value byproducts from composites recycling and convert them into new thermoset materials with high circularity,&rdquo; Moore says. &ldquo;This work contributes to net-zero waste manufacturing and highlights the potential of electrochemistry for polymer upcycling.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The research team also reports significant chemical advances in their study, which they say is the&nbsp;first scalable demonstration of dual carbon-hydrogen functionalization along a complex polymer backbone. Previous approaches to this type of modification have been limited to mild changes, or relied on end-group chemistry, rather than directly &ldquo;editing&rdquo; the oligomer chain itself at the carbon-hydrogen sites.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In doing so, we found that tertiary allylic carbon-hydrogen sites in these branched oligomers are more reactive than expected, which is important new chemistry in its own right,&rdquo; Moore explains.</p>\n\n<p>The team is already pursuing further studies, including possibly extending this electrochemical method to other materials, specifically polybutadiene, a key component in synthetic rubber and high-impact polymer blends.</p>\n\n<p>This work was supported as part of the REMAT EFRC, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana&ndash;Champaign.</p>\n\n<p>The paper was published in <em>Nature Synthesis</em> and can be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-025-00876-7\" target=\"_blank\">accessed here</a>.</p>"
