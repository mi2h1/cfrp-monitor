The HondaJet <em>Echelon</em>, planned to achieve first flight in 2026, will feature a larger cabin with increased passenger capacity and range over previous HondaJet models, bringing the award-winning design features of the HondaJet to a new segment of the aviation market.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/spirit-aerosystems-to-build-new-composite-fuselage-for-hondajet\" target=\"_blank\">June 2023</a>, Honda Aircraft announced Spirit AeroSystem&rsquo;s&nbsp;(Wichita, Kan., U.S.) expanded role in developing the aircraft&rsquo;s&nbsp;build-to-print composite fuselage and a composite bonded frame.&nbsp;Honda Aircraft&rsquo;s production department began introducing specialized assembly lines early in 2024, with tooling installation completed at the end of the year. With work on the first major sub-assembly of the <em>Echelon</em> underway, the program has entered its next development phase. The company is producing test articles to facilitate the maturation of the design in support of aircraft certification.</p>\n\n<p>In January 2025, the Honda Aircraft Company Advanced Systems Integration Test Facility (ASITF) held a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> development simulator, which now serves several functions, including a vehicle for system development testing. The development simulator uses data from wind tunnel models of the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> and real aircraft hardware to predict aircraft performance in operational conditions, enabling engineers to evaluate key aircraft systems prior to the test aircraft taking flight.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are excited to see the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> program gaining momentum,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Honda Aircraft Co. senior vice president and chief commercial officer Amod Kelkar. &ldquo;We are proud of the achievements we have made in the last several months, and it is just the beginning. We have a series of additional targets to hit in the coming months, each of which will bring us closer to the actual first flight next year [2026]. Market interest in the HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> grows, with almost 500 letters of intent signed to date, and numbers increasing every month.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The HondaJet <em>Echelon</em> is planned to become the &ldquo;first&rdquo; light jet with a range capable of nonstop transcontinental flight across the U.S., offering 40% better fuel efficiency than some midsize jets. The new aircraft will introduce product features previously unseen in the HondaJet line, while still building on the high performance and operational efficiency of the original HondaJet.</p>"

Source | Leki&nbsp;Lenhart GmbH</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ditf.de/en/index/ditf.html\" target=\"_blank\">German Institutes of Textile and Fiber Research Denkendorf</a>&nbsp;(DITF) and <a href=\"https://www.leki.com/int/en\" target=\"_blank\">Leki&nbsp;Lenhart GmbH</a> (Kirchheim unter Teck, Germany) have collaborated on a project to develop a hiking pole made largely from renewable raw materials &mdash; in this case natural fiber composites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Consumers are increasingly asking for environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional materials. Aluminum and carbon fibers, for example, require a lot of energy to manufacture and are usually difficult to recycle. Therefore, the aim of the research project was to develop sustainable and durable sports poles made of hemp fibers and a bio-based matrix, which are manufactured using the pultrusion process.</p>\n\n<p>The shaft of the final hiking pole product is made of regionally harvested hemp fibers that have been processed to rovings using the&nbsp;Kemafil-process &mdash; a wrapping process that gives the fibers a stable, rope-like structure through an interweaving technique. The matrix used was developed together with project partner&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bio-composites.eu/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Bio-Composites and More GmbH</a>&nbsp;(Ipsheim, Germany) and is based on epoxidized linseed oil, which can be cured in the same way as a synthetic epoxide resin. The matrix is up to 42% organic and is ideal for the energy- and material-efficient pultrusion process. At DITF, approximately 16 meters of tubular profiles were successfully pultruded on a laboratory scale. The manufactured parts have a smooth surface and the natural fibers used are visible.</p>\n\n<p>The suitability of the process for series production was demonstrated by manufacturing under industrial conditions at&nbsp;industrial partner&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cg-tec.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">CG TEC GmbH</a>&rsquo;s (Spalt, Germany) site.</p>\n\n<p>Other components besides the shaft are also sustainable: The wrist strap is made of a natural fiber fabric and the attachments are made of a bio-based polymer. This means that more than&nbsp;64%&nbsp;of the entire hiking pole is made from renewable raw materials.</p>\n\n<p>Initial market analyses indicate very good commercial viability and user satisfaction. While hemp fibers have previously been used mainly in applications with low mechanical requirements, the DITF reports that the product proves that this natural fiber material is also suitable for resilient structures. The hiking poles manufactured achieve a bending strength comparable to that of aluminum poles and even offer improved damping properties. Thanks to its reduced carbon footprint, the product is sustainable and environmentally friendly.</p>\n\n<p><em>The DITF thanks the Federal Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg for funding the&nbsp;Hanf-Profil&nbsp;research project.</em></p>"

It exhibited less than 1.2% weight loss after 10,000 hours at 350&deg;F (177&deg;C), with hints of microcrack initiation delayed until 6,000-7,500 hours. Even after 10,000 hours, cracking was limited and not close to the level of crack transfer to part or vacuum loss.</p>\n\n<p>Janicki Industries confirmed TP2230&rsquo;s ease of use and durability in tooling trials. The material showed optimal handling, smooth surface finish&nbsp;and consistent performance across multiple cycles. Tools retained vacuum integrity well beyond typical expectations, with only minor wear observed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;By combining reduced cure temperature with long-term thermal stability, TP2230 opens new opportunities for economical, high-performance tooling,&rdquo; says Kaneka Aerospace.</p>\n\n<p>Janicki is now scaling up to larger, more complex tool geometries. &ldquo;The low-temperature initial cure of TP2230 enables&nbsp;us to streamline our tool manufacturing process, opening a pathway to reducing tooling costs and shortening production times while maintaining the high-temperature, high-durability performance of BMI tools,&rdquo; notes Todd &ldquo;TJ&rdquo; Chace, senior director of R&amp;D at Janicki. &ldquo;Backed by robust test data, it stands up to the most demanding conditions of our customers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>Learn more at Kaneka Aerospace&rsquo;s upcoming webinar, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/events/details/tool-smarter-repair-stronger-kanekas-low-temp-bmi-and-advanced-resin-repair-system\">Tool Smarter, Repair Stronger: Kaneka&rsquo;s Low-temp BMI and Advanced Resin Repair System</a>&rdquo; on Nov. 5, 2025.</em></p>"
