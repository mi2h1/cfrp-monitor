It is crucial to control the\nsubstrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an\noptimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,\nit takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is\nfinally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into\nthe tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a\nheating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control\nconcept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other\nsystems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the\nshape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather\ncompact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping\nprocess itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon\nfiber reinforced HDPE tape.",

The recent advancements in\nattention-based Transformer architectures open the door to a more powerful\nclass of surrogate models.

In this work,\nwe introduce a surrogate (meta) model, namely ViT-Transformer, using a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder which are both driven\nby the self-attention mechanism. The ViT encoder extracts microstructural\nfeatures from material images, while the decoder is a masked Transformer\nencoder that combines the latent geometrical features with the macroscopic\nstrain input sequence to predict the corresponding stress response. To enhance\ntraining, we propose a random extract training algorithm that improves\nrobustness to sequences of variable length. We design and construct a compact\nyet diverse dataset via data augmentation, and validate the surrogate model\nusing various composite material images and loading scenarios.

    "summary": "This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming\n(DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems\ngoverned by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space\ninto domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic\nprogramming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early\nevolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population\ncooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical\nsymbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all\npopulations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to\nidentify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic\nconstructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided\npruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic\nprogramming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete\n(SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation,\nand 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and\ntest root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed\nstatistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error\ndistributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in\nvalidation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that\ndomain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve\nconvergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable\nmodeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the\nunderlying physical structure.",

To address this, we develop a new transfer\nlearning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network\n(IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based\non limited thermographic datasets."

    "summary": "Engineering educational curriculum and standards cover many material and\nmanufacturing options. However, engineers and designers are often unfamiliar\nwith certain composite materials or manufacturing techniques. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) could potentially bridge the gap. Their capacity to store and\nretrieve data from large databases provides them with a breadth of knowledge\nacross disciplines. However, their generalized knowledge base can lack\ntargeted, industry-specific knowledge. To this end, we present two LLM-based\napplications based on the GPT-4 architecture: (1) The Composites Guide: a\nsystem that provides expert knowledge on composites material and connects users\nwith research and industry professionals who can provide additional support and\n(2) The Equipment Assistant: a system that provides guidance for manufacturing\ntool operation and material characterization.

However, engineers and designers are often unfamiliar\nwith certain composite materials or manufacturing techniques. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) could potentially bridge the gap. Their capacity to store and\nretrieve data from large databases provides them with a breadth of knowledge\nacross disciplines. However, their generalized knowledge base can lack\ntargeted, industry-specific knowledge. To this end, we present two LLM-based\napplications based on the GPT-4 architecture: (1) The Composites Guide: a\nsystem that provides expert knowledge on composites material and connects users\nwith research and industry professionals who can provide additional support and\n(2) The Equipment Assistant: a system that provides guidance for manufacturing\ntool operation and material characterization.

Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework.

An important application is the\ncomputation of radical chain reactions, including those responsible for the\nphotodegradation of composite materials used in aerospace engineering. Here, we\ncompute the activation energy and reaction energy for hydrogen abstraction from\n2,2-diphenyldipropane, used as a minimal model for a step in a radical chain\nreaction. Calculations are performed using a superconducting quantum processor\nof the IBM Heron family and classical computing resources. To this end, we\ncombine a qubit-reduction technique called entanglement forging (EF) with\nsample based quantum diagonalization (SQD), a method that projects the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation into a subspace of configurations sampled from a\nquantum device. In conventional quantum simulations, a qubit represents a\nspin-orbital. In contrast, EF maps a qubit to a spatial orbital, reducing the\nrequired number of qubits by half. We provide a complete derivation and a\ndetailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its\naccuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.",
