Building on the success of the 47 Molokai, the&nbsp;36-foot fishing platform delivers offshore capability with comfort and versatility.</p>\n\n<p>Built with the same attention to fishing-first functionality, the 36 Molokai is said to deliver &ldquo;serious angling credentials&rdquo; with intelligent deck layout that maximizes fishing space and functionality. Its twin-hull design provides the stability and ride quality that catamaran anglers have come to expect, while advanced construction techniques ensure durability in challenging conditions.</p>\n\n<p>These fabrication techniques include an infusi-core construction.&nbsp;According to <a href=\"https://www.aquilaboats.com/vision/the-aquila-difference\" target=\"_blank\">Aquila&rsquo;s website</a>, &ldquo;vinyl ester and composite coring materials are laminated in a labor-intensive process. This uses numerous vacuum points, ensuring resin&nbsp;impregnates and saturates evenly with minimal vapor or emissions. This is combined digitally &mdash; cut fiberglass and composite to provide exact fit and strength.&rdquo; The use of robotic routers, computer-controlled table cutters and other equipment also achieves a better product, Aquila says, while reducing waste and weight. Framework supporting hull strength is even built in a separate mold to ensure proper placement of other parts during installation, and an exacting fit.</p>\n\n<p>The 36 Molokai also features a carbon fiber hardtop.&nbsp;Unlike traditional fiberglass hardtops, Aquila notes, which may flex or require extensive reinforcement, carbon fiber construction provides an inherently strong, rigid foundation that can handle the demanding loads of a tuna tower installation (outriggers, antennas and electronics) without additional structural reinforcements required.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t set out to build just another 36-foot boat,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Jean Raas, CEO of Aquia USA and chief product officer. &ldquo;We built a fishing weapon that happens to be 36 feet long. Every design decision was made with serious anglers in mind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The 36 Molokai&rsquo;s bow area exemplifies intelligent design, blending relaxation with fishing functionality. Bow sun loungers provide comfortable seating for three crew or guests during transit or downtime, with optional storage beneath for tackle organization and gear. This optional storage feature enables owners to customize their layout based on priorities.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the bow seating, the 36 Molokai maximizes comfort and functionality throughout. An integrated tackle station keeps fishing gear organized and accessible, while the summer kitchen with optional BBQ transforms the boat into an entertaining platform. Pull-out coolers provide convenient storage and create additional aft-facing seating, ensuring ample room for crew and guests whether fishing or relaxing.</p>\n\n<p>While most fishing boats leave crews exposed to the elements all day, the 36 Molokai includes a sleeping cabin with private head, allowing&nbsp;anglers to extend single-day trips into overnight adventures. The cabin also provides a welcome retreat for family members, making the boat more inclusive for mixed-group outings where not everyone wants to fish all day.</p>\n\n<p>The 36 Molokai will debut at Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show in&nbsp;October 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Aquila features a catamaran portfolio that includes models ranging from 28 feet up to 70 feet</p>"

SES will be known as SES Composites.</p>\n\n<p>The first stage of these activities were announced in May 2024, where Hexagon Composites acquired <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/hexagon-composites-sells-lpg-business-acquires-49-of-worthington-ses-business\" target=\"_blank\">a 49% stake in SES</a>,&nbsp;in connection with the sale of Hexagon Ragasco. SES is a European supplier of Type 3 and 4 high-pressure cylinders and systems for the storage and distribution of compressed gases. Its alternative fuels business, SES Composites, manufactures composite cylinders and systems in Słupsk, Poland, and operates a valve assembly facility in Burscheid, Germany.</p>\n\n<p>The industrial gas business, which produces steel cylinders from SES&rsquo; facility in Kienberg, Austria, will remain in joint ownership. The carve-out and acquisition of SES Composites by Hexagon will create a more focused industrial gas business and enable increased strategic focus on value creation in existing and emerging segments.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This acquisition brings complimentary capabilities to our portfolio and can realize further synergies across our production and supply chain,&rdquo; says Phillip&nbsp;chramm, CEO of Hexagon Composites. &ldquo;As recognized by European OEMs, natural gas, whether renewable or conventional, will remain a key part of the European energy transition for the foreseeable future, and this acquisition strengthens our position as a trusted partner to OEMs in the commercial transportation sector.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Similar to Hexagon, SES Composites is a major supplier of CNG fuel systems to European transit bus OEMs. In 2024, SES Composites generated revenue of &euro;28 million and an EBITDA of &euro;700,000 on a pro-forma basis. Based on the existing order backlog and business outlook, 2025 revenue and EBITDA are expected to be &euro;33 million and &euro;2 million, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>The transaction is valued at an Enterprise Value of &euro;11.7 million (100% basis), with a preliminary net purchase price of &euro;6.1 million. The purchase price will be settled partly in Hexagon Composites shares and partly in Hexagon Purus shares. Based on the preliminary purchase price and 30-day volume weighted average share prices, Worthington will receive the following number of shares:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>2,117,851 Hexagon Composites shares, corresponding to 1.0% of shares outstanding. These shares are covered by treasury balance, and no new shares will be issued as part of the transaction.</li>\n\t<li>19,555,225 Hexagon Purus shares, corresponding to 4.6% of shares outstanding. Consequently, Hexagon&rsquo;s post-transaction ownership in Hexagon Purus will be 33.8%.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The transaction will be subject to customary completion accounts adjustments and is expected to close by the end of Q3 2025 following an Austrian demerger procedure. Worthington has agreed to enter into 30-day lock-up agreements related to both the Hexagon Composites shares and the Hexagon Purus shares taking effect from closing.</p>"

Selected as one of only 44 successful projects from a pool of 2,134 applications, ChemR is an ambient-condition chemical recycling process for advanced composite materials. Uplift360 says it has the potential to transform carbon fiber&nbsp;waste management across aerospace, automotive, defense and clean energy sectors.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This grant is a major step forward. ChemR shows that high-performance recycling can be both clean and scalable,&rdquo; says Harry Miller, product and engineering director at Uplift360.</p>\n\n<p>As much as 50% of carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP)&nbsp;is wasted during manufacturing; the U.K. alone currently produces between 30,000-50,000 tonnes of CFRP waste annually &mdash; material with a potential value exceeding &pound;1.2 billion if effectively recycled. With only 20% of CFRP waste currently recycled,&nbsp;and less than 2% reused due to limitations in thermal and mechanical recycling methods,&nbsp;there still remains an urgent need for scalable, sustainable recycling alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>Uplift360 says ChemR <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/kc/sustainability/composites-suppliers-resource\" target=\"_blank\">addresses this critical gap</a> by enabling low-energy, high-quality recycling aligned with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The U.K. MOD&rsquo;s Defence Circularity Concept Note, by reinforcing the need for resilient supply chains and strengthening U.K. sovereign defense capability</li>\n\t<li>The U.K. Critical Minerals and Advanced Materials Strategies, by enhancing domestic recycling capacity</li>\n\t<li>Waste and circular economy policies, by offering a scalable route to reuse high-value fibers&nbsp;and reduce industrial reliance on imports.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ChemR is a proprietary chemical recycling process that reuses its solvent between batches and is capable of operating at room temperature and pressure. It delivers high-purity recovered fibers ready for reinjection into composites manufacturing. Its direct solvent reuse and mild operating conditions offer a clean,&nbsp;cost-effective alternative for manufacturers facing carbon reduction targets and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Uplift360&rsquo;s next steps include the delivery of&nbsp;a pilot-scale ChemR system, conducting real-world demonstrations with partners&nbsp;and building evidence to support commercial roll-out across high-value industries. The project will aim to scale the ChemR process to an integrated pilot line, demonstrate that chemical recycling can be cost-effective, preserve fiber quality with no degradation and adapt flexibly across different applications.</p>"

To inform policy development and infrastructure planning, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eucia.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">European Composites Industry Association</a> (EuCIA,&nbsp;Brussel, Belgium) has estimated the volume of thermoset composites waste accessible for recycling. This data will also support the activities of the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/eucia-publishes-declaration-of-the-european-circular-composites-alliance\" target=\"_blank\">new European Circular Composites Alliance</a> (ECCA).</p>\n\n<p>The effective management of end-of-life (EOL) composites requires accurate data on waste volumes. However, the amount of composites waste generated in Europe is not officially monitored. EuCIA has therefore been collaborating with its members and partners to estimate the potential size of the composites recycling market.</p>\n\n<p>EuCIA has developed a model based on the gross domestic product (GDP) of European countries which predicts a total volume of thermoset composites waste of about 914 kilotons&nbsp;in Europe in 2025. In reality, the situation is more complex and the volume currently accessible for recycling is much lower for several reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Some composite components (like wind turbine blades) are exported for reuse outside of Europe.</li>\n\t<li>In many cases, composite parts are embedded in infrastructure that cannot be easily retrieved for recycling, such as underground pipes and tanks.</li>\n\t<li>Collection and sorting systems tailored to recycling composites are limited and therefore a large number of end-of-use composite products are not collected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EuCIA conducted a deeper analysis per market, taking into account a number of factors, including the existence of established collection and recycling routes. This indicates that the actual volume of thermoset composites waste accessible for recycling is likely to be around 228 kilotons in 2025, approximately 25% of the theoretical amount predicted by the GDP waste model. Of this, EuCIA estimates that currently a maximum of 5% is being recycled.</p>\n\n<p>These figures, EuCIA believes, clearly show an untapped resource that could potentially be returned to the value chain. But exploiting this opportunity will require the building of a robust European value chain and infrastructure to enable reuse and recycling of composite materials. Longer term, establishing systems to enable more widespread collection and sorting of composites waste will be key to fully realizing a circular economy for composite materials.</p>\n\n<p>Further information, including estimates of the size of the composites waste streams generated by different market sectors, is available in a new publication, &ldquo;Reimagining end-of-use composites as a new resource.&rdquo; This is available to download <a href=\"https://eucia.eu/knowledge-hub/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">from the EuCIA Knowledge Hub here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This waste data will be input into the activities of the ECCA, which aims to identify and resolve the legal, economic and technical barriers to composites recycling. The alliance will recommend essential policy updates, such as the creation of dedicated waste codes for EOL composites, to enable the scaling up of sustainable composites recycling solutions. It will also promote the building of markets for secondary (recycled) composites.</p>\n\n<p>The ECCA is a sectorial alliance of EuCIA, launched in partnership with JEC (Paris, France) in March 2025. All stakeholders <a href=\"https://eucia.eu/ecca\" target=\"_blank\">are invited</a> to join the alliance to drive collective action and build a circular and competitive future for Europe&rsquo;s composites industry. The first meetings of the ECCA Working Groups will take place in August 2025.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The collaboration of Europe&rsquo;s composites stakeholders is essential to achieve the full circularity of composite materials,&rdquo; states Rapha&euml;l Pleynet, EuCIA&rsquo;s managing director. &ldquo;ECCA members will commit to this goal, working together to fully establish the circular economy for composites by implementing strategies for greater reuse, repair, repurposing and recycling, and setting and delivering on targets for the recycling of existing products.&rdquo;</p>"

Source | L3Harris</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.l3harris.com/\" target=\"_blank\">L3Harris Technologies</a> (Melbourne, Fla., U.S.) has&nbsp;announced plans to build more than 20 new manufacturing facilities in Calhoun County, Arkansas, that will produce large solid rocket motors, which L3Harris confirmed are manufactured using materials like&nbsp;fiber-reinforced composites. The new manufacturing facilities will add to L3Harris&rsquo; existing site in south Arkansas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>Arkansas is a place for L3Harris to fortify the domestic solid rocket motor industrial base with its dedicated workforce and strong state and local partnerships,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Christopher E. Kubasik, chair and CEO, L3Harris. &ldquo;Large solid rocket motors are essential to our nation&rsquo;s missile and strategic defense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>L3Harris is investing nearly half a billion dollars across its major production sites to support solid rocket motor production, including $193 million to be spent in Arkansas, with Arkansas businesses, to support the construction and activation of these new Camden LSRM facilities. Construction of more than 20 buildings in Calhoun County will add more than 130,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space supporting production of large solid rocket motors that can power missile defense targets, interceptors and hypersonic vehicles. L3Harris&rsquo;&nbsp;new LSRM production facilities are expected to provide a six-fold increase in manufacturing capacity.</p>\n\n<p>L3Harris Camden, Arkansas, site is the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Center of Excellence for Solid Rocket Motor production.&rdquo; Approximately 1,300 Camden employees manufacture more than 100,000 solid rocket motors a year, from those that fit in the palm of your hand to the size of an SUV. In February 2025, L3Harris announced it began construction on four new solid rocket motor production facilities in Camden. That expansion effort is part of a cooperative agreement between the Defense Department&rsquo;s Defense Production Act Title III program and L3Harris to increase domestic rocket propulsion manufacturing capacity.</p>"
