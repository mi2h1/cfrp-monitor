There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework. I am optimistic the ROI&rsquo;s findings and recommendations will help improve awareness of the risks and the importance of proper oversight while still providing a pathway for innovation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The board determined the primary contributing factors were OceanGate&rsquo;s inadequate design, certification, maintenance and inspection process for the <em>Titan</em>. Other factors cited in the report include a toxic workplace culture at OceanGate, an inadequate domestic and international regulatory framework for submersible operations and vessels of novel design, and an ineffective whistleblower process under the Seaman&rsquo;s Protection Act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The board also found OceanGate failed to properly investigate and address known hull anomalies following its 2022 <em>Titanic</em> expedition. Investigators determined the <em>Titan</em>&rsquo;s real-time monitoring system generated data that should have been analyzed and acted on during the 2022 <em>Titanic</em> expedition. However, OceanGate did not take any action related to the data, conduct any preventative maintenance or properly store the <em>Titan</em> during the extended off season before its 2023 <em>Titanic</em> expedition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>MBI recommendations include restricting the Oceanographic Research Vessel designations for submersibles;&nbsp;expanding federal and international requirements to all submersibles conducting scientific or commercial dives; and requiring Coast Guard documentation for all U.S. submersibles. The board also recommended adding Coast Guard personnel capacity at Coast Guard headquarters to support new construction oversight and field inspections involving submersibles and vessels of novel design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Further recommendations include requiring operators to submit dive and emergency response plans to the local Coast Guard officer in charge, marine inspection; evaluating the Coast Guard&rsquo;s subsea search and rescue capabilities; and working with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to define passenger submersibles and expand international safety requirements for submersibles operating on the high seas.&nbsp;The board also called for a new Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Coast Guard agreement to clarify whistleblower investigative protocols and improve interagency coordination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Marine Board&rsquo;s report is now under review by the Commandant of the Coast Guard. Upon completion of the review, the Commandant will issue a Final Action Memorandum confirming the U.S. Coast Guard&rsquo;s position on the recommendations and any actions to be pursued. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The complete Marine Board report can be <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Aug/05/2003773004/-1/-1/0/SUBMERSIBLE%20TITAN%20MBI%20REPORT%20(04AUG2025).PDF\" target=\"_blank\">downloaded here</a>.</p>"

Source | Exel Composites, QHeat</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Global composites manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/exel-composites-plc\" target=\"_blank\">Exel Composites</a> (Vantaa, Finland) has completed an R&amp;D project with geothermal technology expert <a href=\"https://www.qheat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">QHeat</a> (Helsinki, Finland) to provide composite tubes to store excess heat energy at the Lounavoima waste incineration plant in Salo, Finland. Simulations suggest the glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes enable plant operators to store 14 gigawatt-hours&nbsp;of heat in underground wells 2 kilometers down in the granite bedrock.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to installing a heat storage system, the Lounavoima plant released its excess heat into the air during the summer. When ambient temperatures fell to -20&deg;C in the Finnish winter, its emissions increased because of the supplementary oil burners needed to supply heat at peak times. The energy saved by improving the plant&rsquo;s storage efficiency equates to the heating requirements of 700 detached houses per year.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sixty percent&nbsp;of all EU heat production comes from fossil fuels, and the remaining 40%&nbsp;is still mostly combustion, like natural gas or waste incineration,&rdquo; explains Erika Salmenvaara, CEO at QHeat. &ldquo;In the context that half of global energy use is for heating, we see the environmental gains that electrification of heating can provide.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not perfect,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;Electrification of heating puts significant strain on the world&rsquo;s aging power transmission infrastructure, but innovative engineering can help there too. Grid-enhancing technologies are advancing rapidly and, besides, heat pumps deliver up to 60% more energy efficiency than using electricity directly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Exel Composites&rsquo; R&amp;D department worked closely with QHeat&rsquo;s engineers to tailor the composite tubes to the job&rsquo;s specific environmental and performance requirements. The two teams went through several iterations, optimizing for sizing, connection method, and thermal insulation versus mechanical strength trade-offs.</p>\n\n<p>GFRP is well-suited to the pressure and temperature involved with underground applications. The insulating capacity was a great focus for the partnership, ensuring energy efficiency in heat transfer is as high as possible.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Heat preservation combined with the right mechanical performance was the biggest criterion to satisfy with these pipes,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Tiina Uotila, technical sales manager at Exel Composites. &ldquo;However, we collaborated with QHeat to understand how we could make them easier to assemble and install, and to make sure that we have a defined, sustainable end-of-life route. Instead of going to landfill, these pipes will be co-processed into cement, where the reinforcement replaces raw materials and matrix replaces fuels.&rdquo;</p>"

Source | Anemoi</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://anemoimarine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anemoi Marine Technologies</a>&nbsp;(London, U.K.), a company developing carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) maritime rotor sails,&nbsp;has won funding under the sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC). The &pound;1.2 million project will include the development of a next-generation folding sail system tailored to Kamsarmax and Panamax&nbsp;cargo bulk carriers, as well as aerodynamic design enhancements that will significantly increase fuel savings.</p>\n\n<p>The U.K. CMDC&nbsp;has so far directed &pound;136 million in government funding to engineering innovators developing cutting-edge maritime decarbonization solutions, with the aim of driving growth for coastal communities and cementing the U.K.&rsquo;s as a clean energy leader. The CMDC funding gives Anemoi the opportunity to further strengthen its technology leadership in the rapidly growing wind-assisted propulsion sector.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For more information, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/anemoi-installs-composite-rotor-sails-on-sohar-max-maritime-vessel\">Anemoi&nbsp;installs 35-meter-tall composite rotor sails on Sohar Max maritime vessel</a>&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;While our rotor sails are already efficient and high-performing, ongoing innovation is essential to unlock further efficiency gains, adapt to evolving vessel designs&nbsp;and meet increasingly ambitious environmental targets,&rdquo; says Clare Urmston, CEO of Anemoi. &ldquo;This investment underscores Anemoi&rsquo;s potential to support the U.K. in sustainable shipping as the maritime industry works to cut emissions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Under the 7-month project, Anemoi will design, build and test a prototype of a novel&nbsp;folding system for its 3.5-meter&nbsp;rotor sail. The result will reportedly be an &ldquo;industry first&rdquo; for rotor sails of this size, as folding systems have previously only been used on larger 5-meter&nbsp;sails. By enabling sails to be lowered during port operations, the design has the potential to&nbsp;significantly reduce operational obstacles to the uptake of wind-assisted propulsion. Operational seamlessness is a core element of Anemoi&rsquo;s offering, as the company also offers a rail deployment system, which allows the rotor sails to move along the deck of the ship.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to folding system development, the project will cover additional design optimizations, which are expected to improve the aerodynamic performance of wind-assisted vessels, delivering increased fuel savings and emissions reductions compared to Anemoi&rsquo;s current state-of-the-art rotor sails.</p>\n\n<p>The test rig will be manufactured by U.K. company Pressure Design Hydraulics Engineers, with aerodynamic enhancements developed in partnership with Cape Horn Engineering, supported by Stehr Consulting. Victoria Steamship, a U.K.-based shipbroker, will contribute insights based on its fleet of nine vessels operating globally in the bulk carrier segment, a primary market for folding rotor sails. U.K. innovation accelerator Connected Places Catapult will conduct market research and a port and vessel integration study.</p>"

Source | SGL Carbon</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In early July 2025, <a href=\"https://www.tras.co.jp/en/company\" target=\"_blank\">Tras Ltd.</a>&nbsp;(Mishima City), a Japan-based composites company, unveiled a natural fiber body for the Toyota <em>Hilux</em>, which will compete in the Asia Cross Country Rally in Thailand from August 8-16. <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/sgl-carbon-se\" target=\"_blank\">SGL Carbon</a> (Wiesbaden, Germany), supplied the flax fiber prepreg materials for the car&rsquo;s body.</p>\n\n<p>SGL Carbon says it has been involved in developing prepregs and components made from natural fibers, such as flax, for several years. The ampliTex natural fiber fabric is manufactured by <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/bcomp\" target=\"_blank\">Bcomp</a> (Fribourg, Switzerland) &mdash; with which SGL has collaborated on various projects for some time&nbsp;&mdash; followed by&nbsp;pre-impregnation&nbsp;at SGL&rsquo;s&nbsp;site in Willich, Germany.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A major challenge was the comparatively high moisture absorption of the flax fibers,&rdquo; explains Dr. Thomas Meinhardt, team lead technical marketing prepregs at SGL Carbon. &ldquo;We therefore used a special transparent, fast-curing resin system that has proven particularly resistant to, and is tolerant of, the high moisture content of natural fibers. This ensures an attractive component appearance,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;good mechanical and thermal properties of the composite material, [all of] which are particularly important in motorsports.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The finished prepregs were then processed into the final components by Tras. The company specializes in manufacturing, testing&nbsp;and demonstrating car bodies made from natural fibers. &ldquo;The use of the [SGL&rsquo;s] resin system was an important improvement for us, as we often face very high humidity in Asia, yet the components must still meet the rigorous demands of racing. With this natural car body, we now have a lightweight, sustainable component that looks great, too,&rdquo; says Masanao Nitta, CEO of Tras Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>Components made from Bcomp's flax fiber technologies offer up to 85% lower CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;footprint from cradle to gate compared to pure carbon fiber parts, thanks to the use of renewable raw materials and the possibility of end-of-life thermal energy recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, every gram of weight counts, especially in motorsports. In combination with Bcomp&rsquo;s powerRibs&nbsp;reinforcement grid, similar stiffness and weight as virgin carbon fiber components can be achieved. Furthermore, the natural fiber components perform well in crash tests and provide very good vibration damping, making them useful for demanding motorsport applications.</p>\n\n<p>Toyota subsidiary Toyota Customizing &amp; Development (TCD)&nbsp;and its brands TRD and Modellista, which specialize in converting vehicles into sports and special models, also expressed considerable interest in the project. Due to the high quality of the product, natural fibers may be used in future developments.</p>"

Source | DITF</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ditf.de/en/index/ditf.html\" target=\"_blank\">German Institutes of Textile and Fiber Research Denkendorf</a>&nbsp;(DITF), as part of the European CARBOWAVE research consortium, highlights a novel technology using microwaves and plasma heating to produce carbon fibers in an energy-efficient manner, which also results in more affordable production.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon fiber production is complex and energy-intensive.&nbsp;Stabilization and carbonization of the fibers, which are often made from petroleum-based polyacrylonitrile (PAN), requires slow process control in high-temperature furnaces. Despite the considerable energy input, a low material yield is achieved due to the long dwell time in the ovens.</p>\n\n<p>CARBOWAVE&rsquo;s&nbsp;solution replaces the stabilization and carbonization process. Energy is only induced into the fibers locally, thereby minimizing energy loss. This process also shortens the production time of carbon fibers, enabling higher production volumes with lower energy consumption.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/carbowave-project-finds-alternative-to-pan-conversion-with-up-to-70-less-energy-consumption\" target=\"_blank\">CARBOWAVE&nbsp;project finds alternative&nbsp;to PAN conversion with up to 70% less energy consumption</a>&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Their specific research objectives are to develop an optimal coating for PAN fibers that improves microwave adsorption, to develop a plasma heating system for the oxidative stabilization of PAN fibers&nbsp;and to advance microwave and plasma technology for continuous processes.</p>\n\n<p>The DITF&nbsp;is&nbsp;responsible for implementing these processes in continuous production and on pilot lines in a pilot plant. The DITF&rsquo;s central task is the stabilization of the precursor fibers with plasma technology. This involves combining plasma and low-pressure technology to reduce energy consumption in the stabilization process.</p>\n\n<p>The CARBOWAVE&nbsp;project includes recycling of carbon fibers. Partners believe that the new process will also enable&nbsp;microwave-assisted decomposition of carbon fiber composites.</p>"
