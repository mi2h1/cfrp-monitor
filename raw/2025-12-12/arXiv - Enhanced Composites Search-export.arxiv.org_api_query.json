    "summary": "In this chapter, the Hilbert space framework in the mathematical theory of composite materials is introduced for studying the properties of effective operators. The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertnyĭ realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism.",

We present an integrated SHM framework that combines principal component analysis (PCA), a Bayesian neural network (BNN), and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference, mapping sparse strain gauge measurements onto leading PCA modes to reconstruct full-field strain distributions with uncertainty quantification. The framework was validated through cyclic four-point bending tests on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with varying crack lengths, achieving accurate strain field reconstruction (R squared value > 0.9) while simultaneously producing real-time uncertainty fields. A key contribution is that the BNN yields robust full-field strain reconstructions from noisy experimental data with crack-induced strain singularities, while also providing explicit representations of two complementary uncertainty fields. Considered jointly in full-field form, the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty fields make it possible to diagnose at a local level, whether low-confidence regions are driven by data-inherent issues or by model-related limitations, thereby supporting reliable decision-making. Collectively, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework advances SHM toward trustworthy digital twin deployment and risk-aware structural diagnostics.",

Such operators have recently attracted significant interest from the research community, including in the context of stochastic homogenization. In particular, it has been proved that the spectrum of these operators may feature a band-gap structure in the regime where heterogeneities take place on a sufficiently small scale. However, the nature of the limiting (as the small scale tends to zero) spectrum in the above setting is non-classical and not completely understood. In this paper we prove for the first time that Anderson localization occurs near band edges, thus shedding light on the limiting spectral behaviour. Our results rely on recent nontrivial advancements in quantitative unique continuation for PDEs, in combination with assumptions on the model that are standard in the Anderson localization literature, and which we plan to relax in future works.",

This field of research has received increasing attention over the past decades.

However, plant fibers such as balsa wood and flax often display high hydrophilic behavior, which could affect their mechanical performance and long-term durability. It is therefore imperative to promote further research into the characterization of the cyclic hygrothermal aging behavior of balsa wood core sandwich structures, in particular the identification of moistureinduced strains and internal stresses in the skins and cores, as well as the investigation of moisture desorption processes and the associated thermal shrinkage phenomena in wood fibers, resins and glass fibers. Accordingly, this work employs two complete moisture absorption-desorption cycles to characterize the moisture diffusion behavior of specimens comprising three different materials, including the pure balsa wood, resin-infused balsa and balsa core sandwich structures with two Glass-Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (GFRP) skins. The changes in moisture content and hygroscopic strains in the thickness, length and width directions of all specimens were investigated with a view to identifying the hygroscopic swelling and thermal shrinkage behaviors exhibited during long-term aging cycles.",

Traditional LSP systems, such as copper mesh or expanded foil, reduce lightning strike damage, but are not easily drapable around complex geometries and may introduce delamination-prone regions within the composite. Here, we propose a novel manufacturing strategy for architected hybrid composites as drapable LSP by weaving stainless steel yarns within the woven carbon fiber composites. We varied the metal-to-carbon yarn ratio and stacking configuration to assess damage evolution under quasi-static arc exposures and simulated lightning strikes. Our results elucidate that incorporating hybrid layers into composites significantly reduced surface temperatures, through-thickness damage, and mass loss under both electric arc impacts. The composites with the proposed LSP layers also exhibited higher retention of flexural modulus and strength compared to the reference CFRP. Advanced air mobility (AAM) vehicles, which operate at lower altitudes, face significant safety challenges due to their high susceptibility to lightning strikes.

    "summary": "This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material.

      "value": "This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems."

It is crucial to control the substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore, it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon fiber reinforced HDPE tape.",

The recent advancements in attention-based Transformer architectures open the door to a more powerful class of surrogate models. Attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and computer vision. In this work, we introduce a surrogate (meta) model, namely ViT-Transformer, using a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder which are both driven by the self-attention mechanism. The ViT encoder extracts microstructural features from material images, while the decoder is a masked Transformer encoder that combines the latent geometrical features with the macroscopic strain input sequence to predict the corresponding stress response. To enhance training, we propose a random extract training algorithm that improves robustness to sequences of variable length. We design and construct a compact yet diverse dataset via data augmentation, and validate the surrogate model using various composite material images and loading scenarios. Several numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and accuracy of the ViT-Transformer model and the training algorithm.",

The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values."

The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes.

Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups.

    "summary": "This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming (DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems governed by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation, and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the underlying physical structure.",

    "summary": "Evaluating impact-induced damage in composite materials under varying temperature conditions is essential for ensuring structural integrity and reliable performance in aerospace, polar, and other extreme-environment applications. As matrix brittleness increases at low temperatures, damage mechanisms shift: impact events that produce only minor delaminations at ambient conditions can trigger extensive matrix cracking, fiber/matrix debonding, or interfacial failure under severe cold loads, thereby degrading residual strength and fatigue life. Precision detection and quantification of subsurface damage features (e.g., delamination area, crack morphology, interface separation) are critical for subsequent mechanical characterization and life prediction. In this study, infrared thermography (IRT) coupled with a newly developed frequency multiplexed photothermal correlation tomography (FM-PCT) is employed to capture three-dimensional subsurface damage signatures with depth resolution approaching that of X-ray micro-computed tomography. However, the inherent limitations of IRT, including restricted frame rate and lateral thermal diffusion, reduce spatial resolution and thus the accuracy of damage size measurement. To address this, we develop a new transfer learning-based infrared super-resolution generative adversarial network (IR-SRGAN) that enhances both lateral and depth-resolved imaging fidelity based on limited thermographic datasets.",

Starting from a rate-independent system on a discrete spring lattice that combines local linearized elasticity, gradient-regularized plasticity and stochastic non-local links modeling stiff fibers, we establish a discrete-to-continuum limit in the energetic formulation. We prove that as the lattice spacing tends to zero, an evolutionary solution of the discrete system converges to the unique energetic solution of a continuum limit problem. The limiting continuum model couples classical elastoplasticity with a non-local energy featuring fractional-order interactions that capture the homogenized influence of random long-range reinforcements. These results extend previous static homogenization studies by rigorously treating path-dependent dissipation and showing existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity of the evolving solutions. The work therefore provides a mathematical foundation for simulating time-dependent mechanical response of fiber-reinforced composites with random architecture.",

However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate components, which introduce weak points at the joints.

In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering (3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment, eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly. Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic, outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and efficient manufacturing method.",

Their capacity to store and retrieve data from large databases provides them with a breadth of knowledge across disciplines. However, their generalized knowledge base can lack targeted, industry-specific knowledge. To this end, we present two LLM-based applications based on the GPT-4 architecture: (1) The Composites Guide: a system that provides expert knowledge on composites material and connects users with research and industry professionals who can provide additional support and (2) The Equipment Assistant: a system that provides guidance for manufacturing tool operation and material characterization. By combining the knowledge of general AI models with industry-specific knowledge, both applications are intended to provide more meaningful information for engineers. In this paper, we discuss the development of the applications and evaluate it through a benchmark and two informal user studies. The benchmark analysis uses the Rouge and Bertscore metrics to evaluate our model performance against GPT-4o. The results show that GPT-4o and the proposed models perform similarly or better on the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. The two user studies supplement this quantitative evaluation by asking experts to provide qualitative and open-ended feedback about our model performance on a set of domain-specific questions.

    "summary": "Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach. Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable qualification strategies in engineering informatics.",

    "summary": "Effective properties of composite materials are defined as the ensemble average of property-specific PDE solutions over the underlying microstructure distributions. Traditionally, predicting such properties can be done by solving PDEs derived from microstructure samples or building data-driven models that directly map microstructure samples to properties. The former has a higher running cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide material design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead is amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a focus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace, Helmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we propose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable. Our method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism, which analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to its effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes and analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast Expansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels from structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave propagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful sensitivity information useful for material design. Compared with other PDE kernel learning methods, our method does not require measurements about the PDE solution fields, but rather only requires macroscopic property measurements that are more accessible in material development contexts.",

    "summary": "This study reports the fundamental investigation of a novel composite material consisting of MXene (Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$) and a stimulus-responsive hydrogel (Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) - PNIPAAm). In contrast to previously reported integration of MXene and hydrogels, the material described here offers a tunable porous structure for volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing that maintains its stability and responsiveness in any kind of gaseous environment and in a dried state. Furthermore, its synthesis is significantly simpler and more efficient compared to other studies on porous MXene composites. The presented study focuses on a fundamental investigation of the synthesized MXene/PNIPAAm composite's properties. Thereby, the fabrication and comparison of pure MXene and composite samples featuring either a compact or a highly porous three-dimensional microstructure, reveal unique properties with respect to: (i) controllable three-dimensional spatial arrangement of MXene instead of the prevalent stacked-sheet structure, (ii) reduction of oxidation-induced degradation of MXene and substantially enhanced stability over the course of three months, and (iii) tunable electronic states in response to gas interactions. Material characterization is conducted by scanning electron microscopy and rheology to assess the microstructural and mechanical properties, and in a chemiresistive measurement setup for determination of electrical properties and the evaluation of the composite's potential for VOC sensing in a gaseous environment with the test analyte acetone. These investigations reveal fundamentally novel material effects and properties that address some of the key MXene-related challenges. Additionally, the interplay between the MXene and the hydrogel enables unprecedented opportunities for enhancing the sensing potential of stimulus-responsive hydrogels, specifically in gaseous environments.",

The proposed technique considers the microscopic eigenstrain field accounting for intra-phase damage and inelastic strains. This results in realistic computations by alleviating the post-damage stiffness response, which is a drawback of TFA-based methods. We attain computational efficiency by identifying the preprocessing data solely from the elastic and eigen transformation functions and adopting a reduced order modelling technique with a piecewise constant eigenstrain field throughout the subdomains. The performance of the model is assessed by simulating the response for (a) the representative volume element (RVE) as a homogenized continuum and (b) the various composites under complex load histories with intricate macroscale morphologies. Furthermore, the nonlinear shear stress-strain response of a glass fiber composite is calculated and compared to experimentally measured fracture initiation parameters, failure plane orientation, and strain histories. Finally, we show that $\\mathtt{E}^2$-TFA can accurately and efficiently capture damage and inelastic deformations in order to estimate the mechanical response of composite materials in a better way.",

An important application is the computation of radical chain reactions, including those responsible for the photodegradation of composite materials used in aerospace engineering. Here, we compute the activation energy and reaction energy for hydrogen abstraction from 2,2-diphenyldipropane, used as a minimal model for a step in a radical chain reaction. Calculations are performed using a superconducting quantum processor of the IBM Heron family and classical computing resources. To this end, we combine a qubit-reduction technique called entanglement forging (EF) with sample based quantum diagonalization (SQD), a method that projects the Schrödinger equation into a subspace of configurations sampled from a quantum device. In conventional quantum simulations, a qubit represents a spin-orbital. In contrast, EF maps a qubit to a spatial orbital, reducing the required number of qubits by half. We provide a complete derivation and a detailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its accuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.",

We ruled out the role of debonding of fiber due to imperfect impregnation by using a fiber-pullout test, which revealed that the fiber-matrix interface is strong in the direction of the fiber. Therefore, we hypothesize that a fiber allows the matrix material to rotate around it as in a hinge. We corroborate this phenomenon, which we call the hinge effect, with analytical modelling and experimental data for small and large deformations of a fiber embedded in slender composite beams. We also demonstrate the design of foldable and deployable sheets with hill and valley folds enabled by the embedded fibers. Moreover, the hinge effect warrants further research into physics of how fibers in slender composite structures give rise to the anomalous flexibility. This effect can be gainfully used in designing novel origami structures and compliant mechanisms should be flexible and strong.",

    "summary": "Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays.

      "value": "Ultrasonic Guided Waves (UGWs) represent a promising diagnostic tool for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in thin-walled structures, and their integration with machine learning (ML) algorithms is increasingly being adopted to enable real-time monitoring capabilities. However, the large-scale deployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited generalisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework based on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage localisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to have the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source and target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling effective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about dimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained CNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed MPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different composite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess domains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.

It is commonly believed that as the size of the components decreases, the behavior of a composite converges to the response of a homogeneous material. Here we show that this intuitive understanding of the electromagnetic response of composite media is fundamentally flawed, even at the qualitative level. In contrast to the well-understood local effective medium response, the properties of nanostructured composites can be dominated by electromagnetic nonlocality. We demonstrate that the interplay between the nonlocality and the structural inhomogeneity introduces two fundamentally new electromagnetic regimes, primordial metamaterials and nonlocal effective medium. We develop an analytical description of these regimes and show that the behavior of metamaterials in the limits of vanishing nonlocality and of vanishing component size do not commute. Our work opens a new dimension in the design space of nanostructured electromagnetic composites.",

As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.",

Electrical conductivity measurements were performed, which revealed that the composites are more conductive than the pure PEDOT samples, with this effect depending on EDOT and DBSA contents. Characterizations by SEM and TEM microscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology and structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to explain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects those properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the polymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer chains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant structures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe the conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general effective media theory was introduced.

However, draping plans for the robotic layup of composite sheets are not robust. A plan that works well under a certain condition does not work well in a different condition.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at refining plans based on the observed execution performance. Our framework prioritizes the minimization of uncompacted regions while simultaneously improving time efficiency. To achieve this, we integrate human expertise with data-driven decision-making to refine expert-crafted plans for diverse production environments. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our approach, revealing significant reductions in the number of corrective paths required compared to initial expert-crafted plans. Through a combination of empirical data analysis, action-effectiveness modeling, and search-based refinement, our system achieves superior time efficiency in robotic layup. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in optimizing the layup process, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in composite manufacturing automation.",

While the influence of fiber addition on the mechanical strength of granular media has been studied, much less is known about the flow properties of grain-fiber mixtures. In this article, we explore the effect of flexible fibers on the flow behavior of grain-fiber mixtures above the yield stress. We use a vane geometry to study the rheology of a dry granular material mixed with flexible fibers with different volume fractions and properties. The vane is immersed in the material, and the granular pressure increases with the depth of immersion. When the vane begins rotating, we observe a transient regime, which depends on the number of blades and is associated with the mobilization of material between the blades. Following this transient phase, a stationary regime is reached. By measuring and modeling the stationary flow that develops around the vane, we deduce the effective friction coefficient of the material from the torque measured on the vane. Following this approach, we investigate the effect of the fiber volume fraction and the aspect ratio on the effective friction coefficient of the grain-fiber mixture. Our results show that the effective friction coefficient increases linearly with fiber volume fraction and exponentially with fiber aspect ratio. These findings provide new fundamental insights into the flow properties of grain-fiber mixtures.",

    "summary": "Universal deformations are those that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and with boundary tractions alone, for all materials within a given constitutive class. We study the universal deformations of compressible isotropic Cauchy elastic solids reinforced by a single family of inextensible fibers. We consider straight fibers parallel to the Cartesian Z-axis in the reference configuration and derive the associated universality constraints, which depend explicitly on the geometry of the deformed fibers. We study universal deformations in two cases: (i) deformed fibers are straight lines, and (ii) deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature. For case (i), we provide a complete classification. The universality constraints reduce to geometric restrictions on the orthogonal surfaces, which must be planes, circular cylinders, or spheres. This gives one inhomogeneous universal deformation family: the non-isochoric Family Z1 of combined bending and stretching deformations. In addition, Family 0Z consists of homogeneous deformations that respect the inextensibility constraint. We further show that if all principal invariants are constant and deformed fibers remain straight, then only homogeneous universal deformations are possible. For case (ii), when deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature, the universality constraints become significantly more complex. The existence of universal deformations in this case remains an open problem. In particular, we demonstrate that Family 5 universal deformations of incompressible elasticity, when restricted to satisfy the inextensibility constraint, are no longer universal in fiber-reinforced solids. Finally, we prove that the universal deformations of Cauchy and hyperelastic solids with the same fiber reinforcement coincide.",

    "summary": "Wood's increasing role as a structural resource in sustainable materials selection demands accurate characterization of its mechanical behavior. Its performance arises from a hierarchical structure, where the dominant load-bearing component is the S2 layer of tracheid cell walls-a thick, fiber-reinforced composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in hemicelluloses and lignin. Due to the small dimensions and anisotropic nature of the S2 layer, mechanical testing presents significant challenges, particularly in producing homogeneous stress and strain fields. In this study, we apply micropillar compression (MPC) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) to Norway spruce tracheids, enabling direct and model-free strain measurements at the cell wall scale. Micropillars were oriented at different microfibril angles (MFAs), confirming the expected dependence of stiffness and yield stress on ultrastructural alignment, with higher stiffness and yield stress at low MFAs. For these under compression fibril-aligned kink bands occurred, while shear related failure was observed at higher angles. A parameter study on the acceleration voltage of the Scanning Electron Microscope revealed that electron beam exposure significantly degrades pillar integrity, which could explain data scatter and mechanical underestimation in earlier MPC studies. By controlling imaging protocols and using DIC-based strain measurements, we report the highest direct measurements of wood cell wall stiffness to date-up to 42 GPa for MFA=0°-closer matching micromechanical model predictions compared to previous results. Findings are compared with Finite Element Method-based displacement corrections to establish a robust protocol for probing soft, anisotropic biological composites' mechanical behavior while clarifying longstanding inconsistencies in reported results of wood MPC measurements.",

    "summary": "In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by incorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the desired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending module with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The SMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new strain-limiting layer. A simple closed-loop control algorithm was used to regulate the bending angle of the soft robot within its workspace. A camera was utilized to measure the angular changes in the vertical plane. Different angles, ranging from 0 to 65 degrees, were covered to evaluate the performance of the module and the bending angle control algorithm. The experimental tests demonstrate that using the SMA wire results in more precise control of bending in the vertical plane. In addition, it is possible to bend more with less working pressure. The error range was reduced from an average of 5 degrees to 2 degrees, and the rise time was reduced from an average of 19 seconds to 3 seconds.",

    "summary": "Composite materials are used across engineering applications for their superior mechanical performance, a result of efficient load transfer between the structure and matrix phases. However, the inherently two-dimensional structure of laminated composites reduces their robustness to shear and out-of-plane loads, while unpredictable interlaminar failure and fiber pull-out can cause a catastrophic loss of load capacity. Meanwhile, advances toward uncovering structure-property relations in architected materials have led to highly tunable mechanical properties, deformation, and even failure. Some of these architected materials have reached near-theoretical limits; however, the majority of current work focuses on describing the response of a single-material network in air, and the effect of adding a load-bearing second phase to a three-dimensional architecture is not well understood. Here, we develop facile fabrication methods for realizing centimeter-scale polymer- and carbon-based architected interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) materials, i.e., two-phase materials consisting of a continuous 3D architecture surrounded by a load-bearing matrix across length scales, and determine the effect of geometry and constituent material properties on the mechanics of these architected IPCs. Using these experiments together with computational models, we show that the matrix phase distributes stress effectively, resulting in a high-strength, stable response. Notably, failure delocalization enhances energy dissipation of the composite, achieving specific energy absorption (SEA) values comparable to those of wound fiber tubes. Finally, we demonstrate that the stress state in an IPC can be tuned using geometric design and introduce an example in an architected composite. Altogether, this work bridges the gap between mechanically efficient composites and tunable architected materials.",

We model the ferromagnetic particles in composite by spherical shells: the thickness of the ferromagnetic region $d$ compared to the particles' diameter $D$ can vary in a wide range, from $d\\ll D$ to $d\\sim D$. We assume that the magnetization distribution in such a particle is non-uniform, but forms a vortex-like structure: the magnetization is twisted in some plane outside two vortex cores placed at the poles of the particle. We consider two types of magnetic anisotropy, which help to stabilize such a magnetic configuration: the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy and the ``circular'' uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with easy axis rotated together with the magnetization direction outside the vortex core. The high-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in the limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the permeability on the ratio $d/D$. We showed that for $d\\sim D$ the composite's permeability behaves in similar manner for both types of magnetic anisotropy. It was shown also that for the second type of magnetic anisotropy and in the limit $d/D\\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite similar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization oscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous for both types of anisotropy.",

The sodium-ion diffusion coefficients, estimated using both galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry are found to lie within the range of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-11}$~cm$^2$/s.

    "summary": "Coating thickness measurement and inspection of defects beneath optically opaque surfaces are among the most promising commercial applications of the terahertz (THz) imaging technology. However, there are two main sources of complexity in THz spectral measurements that have resulted in reduced accuracy and high uncertainty in the determination of coating thicknesses. These factors include: 1. The need for \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the complex index of refraction of each coating layer, and 2. The complex and polarization-sensitive reflectivity of samples with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates. In this paper, we propose a combined hardware and software solution to address these two limitations. We employ the polarimetric version of our Portable HAndheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanner and use a novel training model on time-of-flight measurements obtained by sparse deconvolution of the THz time-domain pulses. Our method does not depend on separate measurement of the index of refraction of the coating layers; rather, it relies on a physics-based linear model, trained using a small subset of the sample data. We show that thickness measurements with mean square error of about 10 $μ$m and accuracy of more than 92\\% can be achieved when the useful bandwidth of the scanner is limited to about 1.5 THz using photoconductive antenna emitters and detectors. We show that the anisotropic response of the carbon fiber bundles and the weave pattern structure of the substrate can significantly influence the accuracy of the coating measurement, and therefore a polarimetric imaging approach should be used for inspection of similar samples.",

    "summary": "Partial replacement of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) often optimizes their functionalities, however, accurate characterization of their molar ratios in many cases is challenging. This work presents a method of determining such linker ratios via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of small quantities of powdered samples. The main presumption is taking the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility of the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are provided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs are either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the following systems: [MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-δ)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_δ$, [EuMOF]$_{(1-δ)}$[EuPDCA]$_δ$, [UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-δ)}$[UiO-66]$_δ$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F Free]$_{(1-δ)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_δ$, where 1-$δ$ : $δ$ are the ratios to be determined. Depending on whether the systems were strictly paramagnetic, strictly diamagnetic or mixed, the experimental error of $δ$ ranged between 0.00002 and 0.012, respectively. We expect the presented method to be widely employed since samples only need to be in powdered form and because there is a lack of characterization tools in the area of MOF linker ratios. The presented method is also applicable to resolving the ratios of mixed ordinary paramagnetic systems as well as other types of non-magnetic composite materials such as tapes, zeolites and thin films.",

    "summary": "It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value.

      "value": "It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value.

It possesses similar quantitative behaviours as those for the classical Minnaert resonance due to high-contrast material structures, but occurs for a continuous spectrum of frequencies instead of certain discrete Minnaert resonant frequencies. We present a comprehensive analysis to uncover the physical origin and the mechanism of this new physical phenomenon. It is shown that the delicate high-contrast material structures and the properly tailored incident waves which are coupled together in a subtle manner play a crucial role in ensuring such phenomena. The stress concentration phenomena in both the internal total field and the scattered field components are also rigorously established.

In this work, we introduce a network-based modelling methodology to explore the hypothesis that van der Waals interactions between carbon particles contribute to the formation of a conductivity-promoting network structure prior to curing. We combine a discrete aggregate-based representation of filler with a mesh-free, quasi-static viscoelastic model adapted from bond-based peridynamics, resolving equilibrium states through energy minimization. The resulting particle networks are analysed using graph-theoretic measures of connectivity and conductivity. Our simulations reproduce several unexplained experimental phenomena, including long-timescale resistivity decay, non-monotonic secondary peaks upon strain release, and the increasing prominence of these features with higher filler density. Crucially, these behaviours emerge from the interplay between viscoelastic stresses and van der Waals interactions. We show that the resistance response of the network operates over different characteristic timescales to the viscoelastic stress response. The approach has potential for understanding and predicting emergent behaviour in composite materials more broadly, where material characteristics often depend on percolating network structure.",

    "summary": "Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum structures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to significant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we introduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler spiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes of soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural network-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model accurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and payload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed actuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low average positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator length at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively. Furthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads with an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results underscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.",

Existing data-driven surrogate models partially address these challenges by predicting propagated damage or stress-strain behavior but fail to comprehensively capture the evolution of stress and damage throughout the entire deformation history, including crack initiation and propagation. This study proposes a novel auto-regressive composite U-Net deep learning model to simultaneously predict stress and damage fields during CFRC deformation. By leveraging the U-Net architecture's ability to capture spatial features and integrate macro- and micro-scale phenomena, the proposed model overcomes key limitations of prior approaches. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting evolution of stress and damage distribution within the microstructure of a CFRC under unidirectional strain, offering a speed-up of over 60 times compared to IGFEM.",

    "summary": "Magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) are composite materials comprising an elastomer matrix with embedded magnetic particles, endowing the composite with coupled effective magneto-mechanical responses. It is widely reported that anisotropic MAEs exhibit much stronger magneto-mechanical coupling than isotropic MAEs. However, most efforts to model effective magneto-mechanical properties of MAEs via homogenization focused on isotropic microstructures or those with large separations between particles, to use analytical solutions. In this work, we introduce a periodic homogenization approach to compute effective magneto-mechanical properties of anisotropic MAEs, and analyze microstructural features that enhance the magneto-mechanical coupling. Using the finite element method, we numerically determine the effect of particle shape, gap, and voids on the effective stiffness, permeability, and magneto-mechanical coupling tensors for chain-like periodic microstructures. Using insights gained from the full-field simulations, we derive an analytical expression for the magneto-mechanical coupling in the chain direction, in terms of the volume fraction, gap size, and properties of the matrix and particles. Results show that the overall magnetostriction of anisotropic MAEs is most sensitive to the gap between particles and the waviness of the particle chains, with smaller gap sizes and straighter chains yielding higher overall magnetostriction. Simulations also show that while isotropic MAEs elongate in a uniform magnetic field, anisotropic MAEs contract with much larger strain amplitudes, a result of the attractive forces between particles being much stronger in anisotropic MAEs than in isotropic MAEs. Results provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms that govern magneto-mechanical coupling in anisotropic MAEs, and constitute a toolbox of homogenized MAE material properties.",

    "summary": "This study investigates whether Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs), a recent surrogate model for heterogeneous materials, trained on a micromodel with fixed material parameters, can maintain accuracy for varying material properties without retraining, and propagate uncertainty in a multiscale framework. Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.",

The two/three-dimensional (2D/3D) orientational distributions of the component particles were specified by a Gaussian probability density function.

The estimates of $\\underline{\\underlineε}^{\\rm HCM}$ delivered by the Bruggeman formalism and the Maxwell Garnett formalism are in broad agreement, over much of the volume-fraction range appropriate to the Maxwell Garnett formalism, but the degree of HCM anisotropy predicted by the Maxwell Garnett formalism is generally a little higher than that predicted by the Bruggeman formalism, especially at low values of standard deviation.",

    "summary": "Many high explosive (HE) formulations are composite materials whose microstructure is understood to impact functional characteristics. Interfaces are known to mediate the formation of hot spots that control their safety and initiation. To study such processes at molecular scales, we developed all-atom force fields (FFs) for Octol, a prototypical HE formulation comprised of TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) and HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine). We extended a FF for TNT and recasted it in a form that can be readily combined with a well-established FF for HMX. The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental results and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined TNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate that there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in TNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural environments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal loading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are effective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that TNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond timescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with surface and interface energy. The modeling framework presented here will enable future studies on hot spot formation processes in accident scenarios that are governed by strong coupling between microstructural interfaces, material mechanics, momentum and energy transport, phase transitions, and chemistry.",

    "summary": "We consider the matrix composite materials (CM) of either random (statistically homogeneous or inhomogeneous), periodic, or deterministic (neither random nor periodic) structures. CMs exhibit linear or nonlinear behavior, coupled or uncoupled multi-physical phenomena, locally elastic, weakly nonlocal (strain gradient and stress gradient), or strongly nonlocal (strain-type and displacement-type, peridynamics) phase properties. A modified Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) approach introduces an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE) for CMs of any structure and phase properties mentioned above. The unified iteration solution of static AGIEs is adapted to the body force with compact support serving as a fundamentally new universal training parameter. The approach also establishes a critical threshold for filtering out unsuitable sub-datasets of effective parameters through a novel Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill's classical framework. This RVE concept eliminates sample size, boundary layer, and edge effects, making it applicable to CMs of any structure and phase properties, regardless of local or nonlocal, linear or nonlinear. Incorporating this new RVE concept into machine learning and neural network techniques enables the construction of any unpredefined surrogate nonlocal operators. The methodology is structured as a modular, block-based framework, allowing independent development and refinement of software components. This flexible, robust AGIE-CAM framework integrates data-driven, multi-scale, and multi-physics modeling, accelerating research in CM of any microtopology and phase properties considered. The AGIE-CAM framework represents a groundbreaking paradigm shift in the micromechanics of composites, redefining the very philosophy that underpins our understanding of their behavior at the microscopic level.",

    "summary": "The immersed boundary (IB) method has become a leading approach in cardiac fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries without requiring mesh regeneration. However, the use of nonlinear, fiber-reinforced hyperelastic materials for modeling soft cardiac tissues introduces challenges in computational efficiency, particularly due to the additional projection steps required for stability in the IB framework. These steps often involve sparse matrix storage and computation, which can degrade GPU performance. In this work, we present a novel, fully GPU-accelerated, matrix-free IB method for FSI in anatomically realistic cardiac models. By employing nodal coupling, our method eliminates the need for projection operations in the finite element space. Additionally, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations using Chorin's projection method combined with a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver, ensuring the entire FSI algorithm remains matrix-free and highly compatible with GPU acceleration. Our implementation features several GPU-specific optimizations, including the use of constant memory to store values of nodal basis functions and their derivatives at quadrature points, and texture memory to efficiently implement the semi-Lagrangian discretization of convection terms. These innovations maximize GPU utilization while preserving the complex mechanical behavior of soft cardiac tissue. Benchmark tests demonstrate that our GPU-accelerated solver achieves a $50\\times$-$100\\times$ speedup compared to a 20-core CPU implementation, with comparable accuracy.",
