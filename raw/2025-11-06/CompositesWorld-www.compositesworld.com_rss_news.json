However, when thermoset-derived design principles are applied unchanged, AZL believes the processing and performance capabilities of thermoplastics remain largely untapped. AZL&rsquo;s project therefore takes a holistic approach &mdash; TPC-driven vessel designs, manufacturing processes&nbsp;and material configurations to maximize both economic and technical performance.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-l m-r-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Make sure to also check out...</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composites-end-markets-pressure-vessels-2025\">Composites end markets: Pressure vessels (2025)</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/market-report-composites-and-carbon-fiber-in-hydrogen-storage\">Market report: Composites and carbon fiber in hydrogen storage</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Dr. Martin Kerschbaum, manager ME22 at TME, highlights the motivation behind Toyota&rsquo;s participation: &ldquo;The usage of thermoplastic resins for manufacturing of high-pressure hydrogen storage vessels is of high interest for Toyota. This is due to potential advantages in terms of design, processing, performance&nbsp;and circularity. It is essential to compare and evaluate the diverse options of design and manufacturing strategies for high-pressure vessels based on TPC materials. Gaining additional insights into the key influencing factors on material efficiency, production scalability and realistic cost-structure scenarios is a crucial part of this process. AZL&rsquo;s structured approach &mdash; a combination of know-how in applications, composite materials and production systems with expertise across the entire value chain &mdash; provides Toyota with valuable input for the further development of innovative storage systems.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The 9-month project brings together international industry partners to explore new TPC vessel concepts. It is structured into three work packages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>WP1: Market &amp; Technology Landscape</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;Mapping state-of-the-art technologies, certification protocols&nbsp;and relevant IP.</li>\n\t<li><strong>WP2: Conceptual Design &amp; Manufacturing Strategies</strong> &mdash;&nbsp;Developing vessel architectures optimized for thermoplastics, evaluating design variants&nbsp;and defining production system concepts.</li>\n\t<li><strong>WP3: Performance, Cost &amp; Production Benchmarking</strong> &mdash; Quantifying material usage, recyclability, cycle times, cost per unit&nbsp;and carbon impact to guide industrial decision-making.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By actively involving engineers and decision-makers from participating companies, AZL&rsquo;s JPPs combine technical depth with strategic relevance. Participants not only gain access to engineering results and benchmarking data, but also develop in-house expertise &mdash; enabling them to communicate more effectively with customers, suppliers&nbsp;and investors in the hydrogen and compressed natural gas (CNG) markets.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Steeped in innovative thinking</h3>\n\n<p>Previous AZL JPPs and R&amp;D programs have addressed hydrogen and CNG vessel design, filament and towpreg winding, and thermoplastic processing technologies. Within RWTH Aachen University&rsquo;s ecosystem, AZL combines design, simulation, production and testing infrastructure &mdash; covering the full range of technologies for component development, prototyping and developing production systems.</p>\n\n<p>This expertise is further amplified through the AZL Partnership Workgroup &ldquo;Composite Pipes &amp; Vessels,&rdquo;&nbsp;a dedicated platform for continuous collaboration, knowledge exchange&nbsp;and networking across the global composites industry. This new project on TPC pressure vessels builds on this&nbsp;foundation, offering participants both short-term insights and long-term strategic connections.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;AZL&rsquo;s JPPs create trusted spaces for knowledge exchange,&rdquo; adds Philipp Fr&ouml;hlig, head of industrial services at AZL Aachen GmbH. &ldquo;Our goal is to enable every participant to make well-founded technical and business decisions for their own product roadmap. Companies, independent of newcomers or established players benefit from collective benchmarking, faster learning by first-hand information and a shared understanding of what drives efficiency and competitiveness in TPC&nbsp;pressure vessel technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The next report meeting on&nbsp;Nov. 5, 2025, will provide an update on concept benchmarking and early design results for &ldquo;Thermoplastic Pressure Vessels &ndash; Benchmarking of Design-for-Manufacturing Strategies to Optimize Material Efficiency and Cost.&rdquo; Companies&nbsp;interested in hydrogen and CNG storage technologies are invited to join the consortium, gain access to the project findings&nbsp;and collaborate directly. In addition to this JPP, AZL offers individual R&amp;D support, benchmarking studies,and strategic guidance for companies developing lightweight composite pressure vessels and related components.</p>\n\n<p><em>Interested parties should reach out to Philipp Fr&ouml;hlig, head of industrial services (email:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philipp.froehlig@azl-aachen-gmbh.de/\" target=\"_blank\">philipp.froehlig@azl-aachen-gmbh.de</a>; phone:&nbsp;+49 241 475 735 14)</em></p>"

The first orbital demonstration of the joint material is planned for 2026, when a satellite will carry test panels into orbit for 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>The partnership joins FibreCoat&rsquo;s expertise in aluminum fiber&nbsp;coatings with Lofith&rsquo;s thermoplastic tape and composites manufacturing capabilities. Together, the companies will integrate FibreCoat&rsquo;s coated fibers into Lofith&rsquo;s recyclable, high-performance composites to produce lightweight structural materials designed to meet the extreme demands of space.</p>\n\n<p>During the orbital demonstration, detectors attached to the test panels will track dangerous ionizing radiation with and without shielding, temperature changes&nbsp;and other environmental effects. These results will be key to seeing if the materials are &ldquo;space-ready&rdquo;&nbsp;and meet&nbsp;the need of space companies for resilient, lightweight, cost-efficient materials. The test is expected to take place between the Q1 and Q2&nbsp;2026.</p>\n\n<p>Lofith Composites, launched in 2024, has developed an&nbsp;impregnation process that delivers up to 50%&nbsp;weight reduction and 30%&nbsp;higher strength compared to aluminum, as well as full recyclability. The process also consumes less water than conventional methods.</p>\n\n<p>FibreCoat &mdash; which recently secured &euro;500,000 in funding after winning the Industry category in the DLR INNOspace Masters&rsquo; DLR Challenge, as well as being named the overall winner of INNOspace in Pioneering Technology&nbsp;&mdash; has developed&nbsp;novel way to coat metals and plastics onto fibers, thus combining the properties of the fibers and the coating material, during the fiber&nbsp;spinning process. Its products are reported to offer strength and conductivity at a fraction of the weight and cost of competitor products; its latest Bismuth-based coating brings added functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our goal has always been to deliver the next generation of TPC: recyclable, strong&nbsp;and able to remain robust even in harsh environments,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Amador Garc&iacute;a Sancho, CEO of Lofith Composites. &ldquo;Partnering with FibreCoat enables us to combine our expertise and qualify a material that can be used for satellite panels and a wide range of other applications.&rdquo;</p>"

The X-59 performed exactly as planned, verifying initial flying qualities and air data performance on the way to a safe landing at its new home.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/digital-design-multi-material-structures-enable-a-quieter-supersonic-nasa-x-plane\" target=\"_blank\">Digital design, multi-material structures enable a quieter supersonic NASA X-plane</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/cutting-100-pounds-certification-time-for-the-x-59-nose-cone\">Cutting 100 pounds, certification time for the X-59 nose cone</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/collier-aerospace-hyperx-optimizes-x-59-composite-nose-cone-\">Collier Aerospace HyperX&nbsp;optimizes X-59 composite nose cone</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The X-59 is designed to demonstrate the ability to fly at supersonic speeds while reducing the sonic boom to a gentle thump. In doing so, the X-59 aims to overcome one of the primary barriers to supersonic commercial flight, which is currently restricted over land due to noise concerns. The aircraft&rsquo;s successful&nbsp;development and flight testing will inform the establishment of new data-driven acceptable noise thresholds related to supersonic commercial flight over land, paving the way for a new generation of supersonic aircraft that can efficiently and sustainably transport passengers and cargo twice as fast as aircraft today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Skunk Works will continue to lead the aircraft&rsquo;s initial flight test campaign, working closely with NASA to expand the X-59&rsquo;s flight envelope over the coming months. Part of this test journey will include the X-59&rsquo;s first supersonic flights, where the aircraft will achieve the optimal speed and altitude for a quiet boom. This will enable NASA to operate the X-59 to measure its sound signature and conduct community acceptance testing.&nbsp;</p>"

Generally, carbon fiber&nbsp;composites, and thus carbon fiber tanks,&nbsp;do not like it that cold &mdash; when filled with cool propellants under pressure, small cracks can form.</p>\n\n<p>With these extreme conditions, the PHOEBUS project team has already overcome many technical hurdles &mdash;&nbsp;not only on development and tank concepts but also on measurement &mdash; as there are no off-the-shelf devices that accurately measure minuscule leak rates at cryogenic temperatures as low as -253&deg;C.&nbsp;This has led to the successful development of small 60-liter demonstration &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; tanks, which have shown that <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Future_space_transportation/Tests_prove_carbon-fibre_fuel_tank_for_Phoebus_upper_stage\" target=\"_blank\">CFRP is capable of holding hydrogen in liquid form</a> without leaking, even without a protective liner.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Additional project details...</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Smaller-scale &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; tank models have proven this technology is possible.</li>\n\t<li>ArianeSpace&rsquo;s new test facility in Trauen, Gemany, passed a preliminary design review in June and is being prepared for testing with liquid hydrogen starting in&nbsp;April 2026.</li>\n\t<li>Tanks are made using automatic fiber&nbsp;placement (AFP).

Similar&nbsp;to its work with liquid hydrogen, PHOEBUS has proven the use of CFRP tanks via small demonstration &ldquo;bottle&rdquo; tanks without a protective liner. In addition, following a 2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Future_space_transportation/Tough_tests_no_problem_for_carbon-fibre_cryo_fuel_tanks\" target=\"_blank\">demonstration of holding liquid oxygen in a 2-meter&nbsp;tank</a>, further tests were successful and did not end up in any unplanned disassembly of the tank, as could be feared if the material reacted with oxygen.</p>\n\n<p>An improved tank design has now been expanded to a full-scale 3.5-meter tank concept, which is in the last phases of production: the manufacturing tools are being removed and quality control inspections performed at MT Aerospace in Augsburg. The experience from the PHOEBUS project has enabled a very smooth production of this first full-scale tank element, which will be finished in a few months.</p>\n\n<p><em>PHOEBUS is part of the ESA&rsquo;s Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP).</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<div></div>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PHOEBUS demonstrates the production of its 2-meter-scale liquid hydrogen tank pressure vessel on an AFP machine.</p>\n</div>"

Now, Cygnet&nbsp;Texkimp and McLaren have formed an exclusive licensing agreement that enables&nbsp;Cygnet to market the solution to other industries including aerospace, space, defense,&nbsp;wind energy and industrial as part of a long-term strategy to enable high-rate, sustainable manufacture of composites.</p>\n\n<p>McLaren commissioned Cygnet Texkimp to develop its technology into a full production-scale machine after the two companies took part in the ASCEND program (read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ascend-program-completion-transforming-the-uks-high-rate-composite-manufacturing-capability\">ASCEND program completion: Transforming the U.K.'s high-rate composites manufacturing capability</a>&rdquo;).&nbsp;A prototype high-rate deposition machine has been installed at the McLaren Composites Technology Centre (MCTC) in Sheffield. The&nbsp;technology is already integrated into McLaren&rsquo;s manufacturing processes and is producing structural components for current supercar programs, including the McLaren W1 <em>Ultimate Supercar</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A second industrial-specification ART machine, currently being built at Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s Innovation Centre in Cheshire, will be installed at the MCTC in November 2025, delivering increased manufacturing capacity.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;ART combines McLaren&rsquo;s extensive knowledge and experience of highly specialized carbon fiber&nbsp;engineering with our fiber&nbsp;handling and processing expertise and understanding of mechanics and controls,&rdquo; says Luke Vardy, Cygnet Texkimp CEO.&nbsp;&ldquo;The technology unlocks enormous potential for large-scale global markets to access the benefits of a highly specialized carbon fiber and composites manufacturing solution first developed for aerospace and high-performance automotive-grade composites. It is relevant to many industries for the manufacture of composite structures that are optimized for high performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>ART manufactures high-performance carbon fiber&nbsp;composite parts at rate and with minimal scrap. Lengths of dry composite tape are laid down in rapid and accurate formation, at a speed of up to 2.5 meters/second, in a way that significantly reduces the potential for waste generated by off-cuts that cannot be reused. Up to 95% of the dry tape feedstock used to layer a component goes into the final part.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-Cygnet-McLaren-ART-machine.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"McLaren Automotive and Cygnet Texkimp ART machine.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-Cygnet-McLaren-ART-machine.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>McLaren Automotive and&nbsp;Cygnet Texkimp ART machine.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The solution creates new possibilities for innovation in automotive and aerospace engineering and design through its fiber placement capabilities. This element of the technology enables manufacturers to accurately tailor the load-bearing and stiffness characteristics of the finished part through the strategic positioning of the fibers. Specific adjustment of fiber&nbsp;orientation within the composite material allows for anisotropic stiffness: rigidity can be enhanced in specific directions while flexibility can be maintained elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The process has also been highly automated and digitized to offer extensive handling and real-time monitoring capability. In this way, end users are able to&nbsp;determine that every part has been manufactured to identical specifications, which in turn leads to significant time saving benefits linked to speed of manufacture and reduced test frequency.</p>\n\n<p>A full-scale demonstration machine will be built at Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s Innovation Centre where it will be available for customer trials in early 2026. Within the Centre, organizations will also benefit from Cygnet Texkimp&rsquo;s tape manufacturing capability which includes advanced machines to manufacture dry carbon fiber&nbsp;tapes alongside high-performance thermoset, thermoplastic and ceramic prepreg materials.</p>"
