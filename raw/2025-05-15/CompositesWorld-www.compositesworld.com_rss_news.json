This &ldquo;resin pyrolysis&rdquo; enables HRC to efficiently separate the resin and carbon fibers rapidly without solid or liquid waste. This process is said to retain more than&nbsp;95% of the original mechanical properties of virgin carbon fiber, enabling demanding structural and functional applications.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to preserving performance, the technology significantly reduces the environmental impact of composite production, HRC reports. While manufacturing virgin carbon fiber emits&nbsp;about 19.849&nbsp;kilograms&nbsp;of CO<sub>₂</sub>e per kilogram, for example, the rCF produced through HRC&rsquo;s proprietary microwave pyrolysis process emits just 0.93 kilogram of CO<sub>₂</sub>e per kilogram.</p>\n\n<p>HRC&rsquo;s technology&nbsp;helps to reduce material expenses for automakers, minimizes energy use with no chemical pollution and supports scalability with commercial applications in interior and air curtain automotive components.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-hrc-closedloop-process.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-hrc-closedloop-process.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>HRC's closed-loop system for composite applications.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this closed-loop process &mdash; a&nbsp;scalable business model for sustainable manufacturing&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;can&nbsp;meet rigorous automotive standards while helping manufacturers move toward their carbon neutrality goals, HRC says.</p>\n\n<p>However, the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;vision extends beyond. Its collaboration with the Airbus Lifecycle Services Centre (ALSC) launched China&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/airbus-officially-begins-operations-at-aircraft-lifecycle-center\" target=\"_blank\">first aircraft dismantling and recycling program</a>, converting decommissioned aerospace composites into high-value, low-carbon recycled carbon fiber (rCF) products. Similarly, HRC&rsquo;s partnership with HMC,&nbsp;Airbus&rsquo; joint venture in Harbin, will implement&nbsp;100% carbon fiber recovery, aiming to establish new benchmarks for industrial waste repurposing. HRC believes that these collaborations demonstrate how its ecosystem creates value chains that transcend traditional industry silos, proving that sustainability and profitability can be mutually reinforcing.</p>"

Reducing porosity is key to improving strength, durability and overall performance.</p>\n\n<p>ORNL researchers tackled this challenge with a novel approach: integrating a vacuum hopper during the extrusion process to remove trapped gases and minimize void formation in fiber-reinforced materials. These materials are widely used in LFAM for their stiffness and low thermal expansion but often suffer from intrabead porosity that limits part quality.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers used a short carbon fiber-filled polymer in this project. They found that the&nbsp;new system reduced porosity to under 2%, even with varying fiber content.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Using this technique, we are not only addressing the critical issue of porosity in large-scale polymer prints but also paving the way for stronger composites,&rdquo; says&nbsp;ORNL&rsquo;s Vipin Kumar. &ldquo;This is a significant leap forward for the LFAM industry.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>While the current method is designed for batch processing, ORNL has developed a patent-pending concept for continuous deposition systems, which will be the focus of upcoming research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

The spacing in the peripheral positions enables high flexural rigidity with minimal use of tape. Source (All Images) |&nbsp;&copy; Porsche Engineering</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Close cooperation between Porsche Engineering (Weissach, Germany) and Porsche AG&rsquo;s (Stuttgart) material experts has resulted in the development of TABASKO, a patented tape-based carbon fiber construction method&nbsp;that can create composite components that combine maximum strength and minimum weight while also making use of post-consumer recycled materials, all in a series production process &mdash; thus supporting more sustainable automotive construction.</p>\n\n<p>The goal behind TABASKO&nbsp;(coming from German for &ldquo;tape-based carbon-fiber lightweight construction&rdquo;)&nbsp;was to achieve better material properties at a reduced weight and cost.&nbsp;Currently, many Porsche vehicle components are made of&nbsp;glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (PP)&nbsp;called PP-GFx. Porsche wanted to consider the use of carbon fiber &mdash;&nbsp;however, carbon fiber is still a considerably expensive material. Therefore, they had the idea of reinforcing PP with strategically placed carbon fiber tapes, using less material (and thus reduced cost) and achieving thinner walls, all without sacrificing rigidity.</p>\n\n<p>Porsche&rsquo;s&nbsp;work with a supplier also supported TABASKO&rsquo;s use in series production.&nbsp;&ldquo;The question was: How can you produce up to 80,000 parts a year &mdash; in a fully automated way and cost-neutral compared to today&rsquo;s process?&rdquo; explains Frank H&auml;usler, materials expert at Porsche AG.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Porsche-TOBASKO-strips.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Porsche-TOBASKO-strips.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Top view of the strips of tape, which are only 0.2 millimeter thick. The carbon fiber filaments run lengthwise without interruption, which increases the rigidity compared to PP-GFx by a factor of 20.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>TABASKO is fully automated and uses conventional equipment. It involves &ldquo;inserting tapes into forming tools&nbsp;by means of a handling device and attached to either the top or the bottom of the component using vacuum channels,&rdquo; so they can be easily attached to the component, an additional advantage for production costs. Successful prototype tests involving luggage trays has proven its ability to increase rigidity, reduce weight by up to 20%&nbsp;and that recycled plastics are suitable for component production.</p>\n\n<p>Six patents have been filed for TABASKO, for the material structure, the production method, the tool technology&nbsp;and the process sequence in series production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.porscheengineering.com/en/peg/newsroom/pem-2-24/stable-as-steel/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete story from&nbsp;<em>Porsche Engineering Magazine</em>, issue 2/2024</a>.</p>"

In addition, following <em>TA-2</em>&rsquo;s first flight in December 2024, the company confirms the vehicle&rsquo;s reusability. In March, <em>TA-2&nbsp;</em>surpassed Mach 5 during its trajectory for the second time, exceeding the previous speed record set with the December flight.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;While the team needs to complete its data review of flight two, the first flight review confirmed the robustness of the Talon-A design while demonstrating the ability to meet the full range of performance capabilities desired by our customers,&rdquo; says Dr. Zachary Krevor, president and CEO of Stratolaunch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now demonstrated hypersonic speed, added the complexity of a full runway landing with prompt payload recovery&nbsp;and proven reusability.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Supporting the U.S.&rsquo; defense initiatives, Stratolaunch is focused on expanding its hypersonic flight testing and ensuring the long-term sustainability of reusable hypersonic testbeds. These completed flights demonstrate the U.S.&rsquo; return to reusable hypersonic flight test since the X-15 program ended in 1968.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Stratolaunch-Roc-air-launch-platform-TalonA2-testbed.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Stratolaunch-Roc-air-launch-platform-TalonA2-testbed.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Stratolaunch&rsquo;s&nbsp;composites-intensive Roc air launch platform take off from Mojave Air and Space Port at Rutan Field carrying the <em>Talon-A2</em> testbed.
