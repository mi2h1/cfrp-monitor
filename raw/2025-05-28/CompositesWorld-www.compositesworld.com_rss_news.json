Pritzkow Spezialkeramik (WPS)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.keramikblech.com/en/company/\" target=\"_blank\">Walter E.C. Pritzkow Spezialkeramik</a> (WPS, Filderstadt, Germany), a company focused&nbsp;on the develop&shy;ment and design of light&shy;weight struc&shy;tures made of ceramics, has developed a solution in&nbsp;collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/basf-se\" target=\"_blank\">BASF</a> (Ludwigshafen, Germany) consisting of tubes that combine monolithic ceramics with an oxide ceramic matrix composite&nbsp;(OCMC), creating hybrid burner lances that are advancing operations at BASF facilities worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, petrochemical crackers have faced continuous challenges with metallic burner lances, particularly as hydrogen is increasingly incorporated into processes. The catalytic properties of nickel-based alloys accelerate coking, a damaging carbon buildup that obstructs critical flow passages and leads to overheating, corrosion and ultimately, component failure during removal.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike metal components that require replacement approximately every 6 months, WPS&rsquo; ceramic hybrid burner lances have been operating continuously for more than&nbsp;18 months without issues, with projected service life extending to 10-12 years based on similar operating conditions in other applications.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-burnerlances-h2-walterpritzkow-2.png;maxWidth=385\" /></div>\n\n<p>Close-up of WPS&rsquo; CMC burner lances after 18 months of continuous operation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>According to the company, what makes this solution effective is the application of OCMC&nbsp;where traditional monolithic ceramics would fail. While monolithic ceramics offer the needed chemical inertness, they lack the crack-stopping mechanisms and thermal shock resistance required in cracker environments. Monolithic components would crack during initial heating cycles due to thermal stresses. The combination of the monolithic ceramic with the fiber-reinforced structure of OCMC&nbsp;provides the necessary damage tolerance and thermal shock resistance while maintaining the chemical inertness that makes ceramics ideal for these harsh environments.</p>\n\n<p>This approach delivers multiple benefits to chemical plant operators. First, OCMC components eliminate the catalytic reactions that damage metal parts during operation. They also withstand the high temperatures that occur during decoking processes, which reduces the risk of failure. Additionally, the system incorporates commercially available metal connections that make the ceramic burner lances integrate seamlessly with current systems as a retrofitable solution.</p>\n\n<p>WPS&rsquo;&nbsp;exclusive license for this patented technology by BASF positions the company&nbsp;as the sole provider of this solution. WPS continues to work with BASF to optimize the metal-ceramic connection to simplify the installation process for plant operators.</p>\n\n<p>Walter E.C. Pritzkow Spezialkeramik has more than&nbsp;30 years of experience with OCMC for extreme environments. The company is seeing interest in the technology spreading throughout the petrochemical industry as more companies recognize the potential benefits for their global operations to increase efficiency, reduce maintenance schedules&nbsp;and enable the transition to greener, more sustainable operations.</p>"

Source | SPE Thermoforming Division</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thermoformingdivision.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) Thermoforming Division</a>&nbsp;announces that this year&rsquo;s Lifetime Achievement Award goes to&nbsp;Greg McCunn, staff engineer for materials at John Deere (Moline, Ill., U.S.).&nbsp;The Division&rsquo;s executive committee presented the award to him May 20, 2025, during SPE&rsquo;s Thermoforming Awards Dinner at the Renaissance Atlanta Waverly Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>McCunn began his career in the plastics industry in 1991 as an injection molder supplier to Jeep, which soon after became part of Chrysler. Over the next 7 years, McCunn was involved in eight Chrysler/Jeep product launches, and the molding facilities expanded from one factory with 29 presses to three factories with 53 presses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In 1997, he moved to John Deere as a quality/manufacturing engineer and joined the styling team &ldquo;re-skinning&rdquo; the combine harvester in composites. Later in the buyer role, McCunn learned about purchasing and the company&rsquo;s plastics suppliers. John Deere does not produce plastics and composite-based products, relying on suppliers. Throughout his career, four of McCunn&rsquo;s hand-selected suppliers have won John Deere&rsquo;s Achieve Excellence Annual Supplier Awards.</p>\n\n<p>In 2000, John Deere initiated strategic sourcing to unify the buying communities between John Deere units and simplify the John Deere supply base. In 2002, McCunn joined the strategic sourcing group as a supply base manager for composites. For the next 9 years, he led decision focus efforts and selected sources for composite styling projects throughout John Deere agriculture factories. The mission consisted of pairing the John Deere project engineer with the appropriate material and process for each application. Materials and processes are supplier-specific, so McCunn spent a lot of time on the road visiting potential suppliers and at trade shows learning about processes, suppliers and their capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011, he&nbsp;joined the polymer materials team with the same mission:&nbsp;to align projects with the correct materials, processes and suppliers. McCunn has presented at SPE Thermoforming Conferences and the SPE Thermoset Conference. He has been a staff engineer for materials at John Deere for the past 13 years.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Greg has been instrumental in implementing plastic and composites in John Deere products,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Paul Uphaus, SPE Thermoforming Division chair. &ldquo;He has been a longtime advocate for the thermoforming industry by using the process in his designs, and for that he has our sincere appreciation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>THE SPE Thermoforming Division&nbsp;is a technical division of the SPE. Its mission is to facilitate the advancement of thermoforming technologies through education, application, promotion and research.&nbsp;</p>"
