Source (All Images) | Counterpoint Market Intelligence</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://counterpoint.aero/\" target=\"_blank\">Counterpoint Market&nbsp;Intelligence</a> (Chesterford, U.K.), an aerospace market research consultancy, recently released a white paper entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://counterpoint.aero/2025/06/counterpoint-releases-white-paper-on-the-role-of-composites-in-future-aircraft/\" target=\"_blank\">The Crucial Role of Composites in Next-Generation Aircraft Design</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;This in-depth report explores how advanced composite materials are transforming the aerospace industry by enabling long and thin wings, lighter airframes&nbsp;and&nbsp;significant fuel savings. Counterpoint has written the article in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/hexcel\" target=\"_blank\">Hexcel Corp.</a> (Stamford, Conn., U.S.).</p>\n\n<p>According to ICAO forecasts, air travel is predicted to grow about 4% annually through 2050. Innovations, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or alternative propulsion technology, can assist in getting the industry to net zero. However high costs associate with supply chain development and technology&rsquo;s long timeline may present a challenge for the industry. Therefore, reducing the amount of fuel consumed in the first place using existing technologies is a critical step.</p>\n\n<p>So, what are the key advantages of composite use? Historically, aircraft manufacturers have improved fuel efficiency (in terms of fuel per passenger-mile) through four major levers: improved engine technology, higher density of seats and passengers, aerodynamic improvements&nbsp;and reducing&nbsp;structural weight. The use of composites is a key enabler in three of them. Although engine technology has been a key driver of efficiency in the past, Counterpoint believes that structural weight and aerodynamics will play a pivotal role in future designs as pushing the boundaries with engine technology becomes more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Composites can assist aircraft designers in reducing fuel burn through two primary mechanisms: lowering the weight of the aircraft and optimizing the wing design. This white paper discusses how the distinctive&nbsp;properties of composites enable&nbsp;aerodynamic designs that are not feasible with metallic materials. More than just being lightweight, these aerodynamic efficiencies drive large reductions in drag and resulting fuel consumption.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-counterpoint-whitepaper-singleaisle-opportunity.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-counterpoint-whitepaper-singleaisle-opportunity.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>These advanced materials are already in widespread use in modern aircraft designs, but the untapped opportunity for composite materials remains large. In the chart at right, each stacked represents the empty weight of one aircraft, and the number of bars represents the number of aircraft produced each month based on manufacturer forecasts. Boeing and Airbus&rsquo;&nbsp;current single-aisle aircraft have the highest production rates in the industry. Current generation designs use relatively little composite materials, and next-generation designs have the opportunity to use significantly more composite materials.</p>\n\n<p>The full white paper expands on each of these points, providing examples and data quantify the effects of composites in aircraft design.</p>\n\n<p>The white paper can be <a href=\"https://counterpoint.aero/2025/06/counterpoint-releases-white-paper-on-the-role-of-composites-in-future-aircraft/\" target=\"_blank\">downloaded here</a>.</p>"

It optimizes material use and product performance. Traditionally two separate processes, Taniq has merged&nbsp;filament winding and AFP into one flexible system in an effort to increase&nbsp;production efficiency and unlock&nbsp;new design possibilities.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of this development is Taniq&rsquo;s robotic filament winding machine, extended with an AFP head. The entire process is powered by TaniqWind Pro, a proprietary design and manufacturing software, which supports both winding paths and fiber placement programming in a unified digital workflow.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-taniq-hybrid-solution-infographic.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Taniq hybrid system infographic.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-taniq-hybrid-solution-infographic.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In addition to improving performance and material efficiency, Taniq reports the hybrid system&rsquo;s ability to improve strength-to-weight ratios, reinforcing critical&nbsp;areas without overbuilding the part and thus reducing material consumption.&nbsp;Replacing entire high-angle helical filament-wound layers&nbsp;with local reinforcement layers&nbsp;results in faster production cycles, and a simplified&nbsp;software integration ensures a smooth transition from design to analysis to production.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Taniq&nbsp;has been developing hybrid systems since 2006, combining high-speed filament winding&nbsp;with precise placement of rubber layers&nbsp;and textile tapes.&rdquo; notes Soren Blomaard, Taniq co-founder. &ldquo;This new system, combining filament winding&nbsp;with AFP, is a logical next step for us, and we are already exploring integration of more processes.&rdquo;</p>"

In a partnership that has grown over the past 3 years, SGL Carbon and Carbon Cleanup are returning these materials to the loop.</p>\n\n<p>Using CARB-E, automotive carbon fiber scraps are processed with a near-zero carbon footprint (0.036 kg CO<sub>₂</sub> eq. per kilogram). The recycled fibers are then used as reinforcement in injection molding compounds, giving the material a second life while replacing virgin fibers such as glass fiber. Early applications, including a super sports car front hood, has demonstrated a 30% CO<sub>₂</sub> reduction per part compared to the original material used.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The partnership began as a &ldquo;Frontrunnership&rdquo; to test material recyclability and has since scaled significantly. A dedicated logistics system for the recycling program has been developed, and more than&nbsp;50 tons of carbon fiber scraps have already been recycled in 2025. Volumes are expected to triple by the end of the year, marking a milestone for industrial-scale circularity.</p>\n\n<p>Within the partnership, waste audits, digitalizing waste and iteration loops, a smart AI-supported collection system has also been developed to track waste from the point it is generated all the way to the final product or even second-life part.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For the final product, it&rsquo;s key to know exactly where the waste came from. And for material scientists, that data is gold when it comes to creating the right formulations,&rdquo; says Jakob Schlosser, CTO Carbon Cleanup. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why our system makes sure every piece of waste is tracked, traceable&nbsp;and connected across the recycling network.&rdquo;</p>"

According to HydroGraph, graphene coatings and composites could make Seadar&rsquo;s platforms last longer, perform better&nbsp;and cut costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Graphene is a versatile and durable substance. Partnering with Seadar enables us to develop new applications that can deliver real-world benefits,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Kjirstin Breure, president and CEO of HydroGraph.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Both companies plan to explore applications for HydroGraph graphene for various Seadar&nbsp;applications and systems. For example, adding graphene to Kevlar-reinforced survey lines can increase tensile strength, reduce weight and improve handling. Graphene coatings can reduce corrosion and extend the life of Seadar&nbsp;Shield node boxes and connectors. Graphene composites can make Seadar&nbsp;structural components lighter and stronger, enabling them to handle mechanical loads and subsea pressures. Graphene can also improve thermal conductivity, dissipating heat to protect sensitive electronics.</p>\n\n<p>HydroGraph specializes in commercializing graphene production, supporting materials innovation for marine, aerospace&nbsp;and industrial applications. The company has developed a controlled chamber explosion method to produce few-layered graphene at scale, cost-effectively.&nbsp;</p>"
