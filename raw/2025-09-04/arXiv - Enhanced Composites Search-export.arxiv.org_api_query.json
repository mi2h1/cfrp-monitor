    "summary": "Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck\nin industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced\nvia non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a\nnovel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert\ncharacterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language\nrepresentations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with\npre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual\nmicrostructural data and textual expert assessments into shared\nrepresentations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we\ndevelop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both\npositive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their\nassociated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of\npreviously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.\nValidation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and\ndefective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method\nenhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by\nenabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model\nretraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert\nknowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable\nqualification strategies in engineering informatics.",

The former has a higher\nrunning cost, but provides explainable sensitivity information that may guide\nmaterial design; the latter could be more cost-effective if the data overhead\nis amortized, but its learned sensitivities are often less explainable. With a\nfocus on properties governed by linear self-adjoint PDEs (e.g., Laplace,\nHelmholtz, and Maxwell curl-curl) defined on bi-phase microstructures, we\npropose a structure-property model that is both cost-effective and explainable.\nOur method is built on top of the strong contrast expansion (SCE) formalism,\nwhich analytically maps $N$-point correlations of an unbounded random field to\nits effective properties. Since real-world material samples have finite sizes\nand analytical PDE kernels are not always available, we propose Neural Contrast\nExpansion (NCE), an SCE-inspired architecture to learn surrogate PDE kernels\nfrom structure-property data. For static conduction and electromagnetic wave\npropagation cases, we show that NCE models reveal accurate and insightful\nsensitivity information useful for material design.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents.

The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments\nconducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in\nenhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small\npedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices."

However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.",
