This solution enables in situ repairs, enabling damaged composite components to be healed in minutes, thus reducing downtime and improving cost-efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to showcase how advanced materials can make a tangible economic and ecological difference in the daily operations of the rail industry,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Ama&euml;l Cohades, CEO of CompPair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As part of this collaboration, CompPair&rsquo;s HealTech&nbsp;technology will be integrated into the refit program&nbsp;of the ICN train fleet, beginning in 2025, through existing SBB suppliers. This strategic move ensures seamless adoption within the current maintenance ecosystem, while introducing a step forward in reducing operational costs and environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>The joint project targets the front parts of locomotives, specifically the cowcatchers &mdash; which are&nbsp;exposed to frequent impacts and traditionally requiring regular replacement&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;as the first component to benefit from CompPair&rsquo;s solution. By replacing standard composite parts with repairable ones, maintenance teams will be able to heal damage directly on the part, reducing downtime and avoiding costly replacements. This not only improves operational efficiency but also supports SBB&rsquo;s long-term sustainability goals.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With this collaboration, we are taking a concrete step toward reducing material waste and maintenance costs while increasing the service life of key components,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Pascal Vock, head of research and innovation at SBB.</p>\n\n<p>The SBB is the primary national railway company of Switzerland, responsible for both passenger and freight transport. SBB operates a vast network of more than 3,000 kilometers&nbsp;of railway lines, with 9,000 passenger trains running daily.</p>"

The project successfully demonstrated that Verretex&rsquo;s recycled textile could be processed using Ryse&rsquo;s existing blade layup and curing methods with no tooling or cycle time modifications. The final product also meets IEC 61400‑2, a compliance standard for safety and durability, which Ryse&rsquo;s&nbsp;small wind turbines are designed for.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-verretex-ryse-blade.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-verretex-ryse-blade.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Wind turbine blade comparison.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are constantly evaluating ways to reduce our carbon footprint without sacrificing performance,&rdquo; says Baxter who spearheaded the pilot in Spain. &ldquo;Our team was able to integrate Verretex&rsquo;s recycled textile seamlessly, and the resulting test blades met the strength and durability requirements essential for wind turbine performance. This shows the real-world potential of recycled composites in renewable energy manufacturing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Verretex&nbsp;regenerates&nbsp;textiles from end-of-life and production scrap glass fibers to create virgin-like, low-carbon materials that fit existing production, without requiring the energy-intensive remelting of glass fiber. The significance of this development is backed by a recent life cycle assessment performed by Tech-Fab Europe, which revealed&nbsp;that the production of glass fiber itself is responsible for 89% of the carbon footprint of the final fabric, from raw material extraction to the factory gate (<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/tech-fab-europe-publishes-lca-study-on-glass-fiber-fabrics\" target=\"_blank\">more about the study here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Following the success of this Spain-based pilot, Verretex is planning to scale its production capacity to meet customer demand and bring costs in line with industry standards. Once volumes and price allow, Ryse Energy plans to integrate these circular materials across its global footprint in Spain, Europe and the U.S., moving&nbsp;into scaled production on turbine models.</p>"

The team, made up of 18 students from Delft University of Technology (Netherlands), secured its eighth victory in the event. The car ran on Bridgestone solar car tires with its Enliten&nbsp;technology, which included belt reinforcement made with Twaron Next&nbsp;supplied by <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/teijin-aramid-bv\" target=\"_blank\">Teijin Aramid</a>&nbsp;(Arnehm, Netherlands). This result highlights the strength of Dutch engineering and the role of advanced materials in enabling next-generation mobility.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>What is Twaron Next?</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.teijinaramid.com/en/products/twaron-next\" target=\"_blank\">Twaron Next</a>&nbsp;is Teijin Aramid&rsquo;s&nbsp;new high-performance para-aramid fiber made using reclaimed aramid. It is manufactured using the same polymer and spinning technology as standard Twaron, ensuring full compatibility with existing specifications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Twaron Next&nbsp;is reported to deliver the same mechanical performance as standard Twaron, enabling more responsible material choices without compromising quality.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our role is to provide materials that enable ideas to come to life, even in demanding conditions,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Hendrik de Zeeuw, chief commercial officer, Teijin Aramid. &ldquo;This challenge shows what can happen when we back the next generation of engineers with sustainable, high-performance solutions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s winning vehicle, <em>Nuna 13</em>, was built with one purpose: efficiency. It weighs just 160 kilograms and runs on a custom-designed, ironless in-wheel motor that achieves 98%&nbsp;operational efficiency. Its asymmetric catamaran shape, developed through 6 months of aerodynamic modeling, was validated through full-scale wind tunnel testing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get a second chance out there,&rdquo; notes Thijmen God, technical manager, Brunel Solar Team. &ldquo;The car has to behave exactly as expected, and that only works if the systems are built to work together from the start.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The design features two vertical fins that help convert side winds into forward motion, improving both speed and stability. The Bridgestone solar car tires with its Enliten&nbsp;technology were reinforced with Teijin Aramid&rsquo;s product, Twaron Next. Twaron&nbsp;was also used in the vehicle&rsquo;s protective driver shield. This version of Twaron&nbsp;contains circular content and has contributed to enhancing the tire&rsquo;s performance and environmental profile. <em>Nuna 13</em> marks&nbsp;the first industrial-scale use of this material&nbsp;in a real-world application.</p>\n\n<p>Teijin Aramid&rsquo;s support of the Brunel Solar Team is part of its broader brand platform, Materializing Ambitions, which highlights real-world stories of engineering transformation across industries and geographies. As part of this initiative, Teijin Aramid has released a three-part documentary series, &ldquo;Building Nuna,&rdquo; capturing the Brunel team&rsquo;s journey from classroom theory to high-performance competition.

The facility will operate alongside Safran Landing Systems&rsquo; existing production plants worldwide in Villeurbanne (France), Walton (U.S.) and Sendayan (Malaysia). Scheduled to begin operations in 2030, the site will enable Safran to achieve gradually an increase in volumes of 25% by 2037.</p>\n\n<p>This 30,000-square-meter facility represents an investment of more than&nbsp;&euro;450 million once fully completed. Equipped with technology and industrial systems specifically developed for this project, the facility will be highly automated and will offer employees a working environment of the highest standards. It will have around 100 highly qualified employees when it opens and will double its workforce at full capacity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>This announcement follows other carbon brake developments made earlier this year.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.safran-group.com/pressroom/safran-inaugurates-new-industrial-facilities-landing-and-braking-systems-molsheim-france-2025-06-04\" target=\"_blank\">In June</a>, Safran&nbsp;inaugurated&nbsp;new industrial facilities for landing and braking systems in Molsheim, France, an investment that&nbsp;modernized&nbsp;and increased&nbsp;the Alsace site&rsquo;s production and maintenance capacities for landing and braking systems, to keep pace with the increasing production rates of aircraft manufacturers and the growing MRO&nbsp;needs of airlines.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.safran-group.com/pressroom/spirit-airlines-renews-its-partnership-safran-supply-and-mro-its-airbus-a320-wheels-and-carbon-2025-04-10\" target=\"_blank\">In April</a>,&nbsp;Spirit Airlines renewed&nbsp;its partnership with Safran for the supply and MRO of its Airbus A320 wheels and carbon brakes, a&nbsp;contract that covers both the Airbus A320ceo and A320neo in service and more to be delivered in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Safran Landing Systems currently equips 55% of commercial airliners with over 100 seats and supports more than 500 airlines worldwide on a daily basis.&nbsp;Safran carbon brakes are made from&nbsp;carbon-based materials, specifically carbon composites for the disks and pads, which are a blend of carbon fibers and ceramic materials like silicon carbide. Carbon brakes are lighter, more efficient and three times more durable than steel brakes and help operators reduce fuel consumption.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Since energy can account for up to 30% of the cost of manufacturing a carbon brake, the choice of location was dependent on a guarantee of secure access to low-carbon electricity at a stable and competitive price over the long term. The facility, says&nbsp;Olivier Andri&egrave;s, CEO&nbsp;of Safran, &ldquo;ensuring our ability to support our customers, against a backdrop of strong air traffic growth.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>These new technologies will also enable the plant to achieve zero emissions in support of Safran&rsquo;s environmental commitments.&nbsp;It will use biomethane and low-carbon electricity. As a result, its electricity and gas consumption will be reduced by nearly 30% and water consumption by 80%.

The one-piece additive manufactured composite vessel was enabled by large-scale 3D printing center&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lamaquina.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Lam&aacute;quina</a>&nbsp;(Barcelona, Spain).</p>\n\n<p>This student-led design project was engineered by&nbsp;Lam&aacute;quina to create a full functional, innovative vessel.&nbsp;Constructed from fiberglass-reinforced PETG, Asket was&nbsp;printed with a <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/cead-bv\" target=\"_blank\">CEAD</a>&nbsp;(Delft, Netherlands)&nbsp;E25 pellet&nbsp;extruder mounted on a <a href=\"https://www.kuka.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">KUKA</a>&nbsp;(Augsburg, Germany) robotic arm at&nbsp;Lam&aacute;quina&rsquo;s Barcelona facility.&nbsp;Measuring 141 centimeters&nbsp;in length, 67 centimeters in width&nbsp;and 28 centimeters in height, the boat&nbsp;was completed in under 10 hours,&nbsp;achieving complete watertightness without any postprocessing or assembly.</p>\n\n<p>To enhance buoyancy and impact resistance, Asket&rsquo;s base&nbsp;incorporates a custom solid infill pattern. Stability and performance are further optimized through variable wall thickness &mdash;&nbsp;7.5 millimeters at the bottom for a low center of gravity, tapering to 5.5 millimeters at the top to reduce weight. This gradient improves both balance and material efficiency.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n<p>Advanced active layer time management was employed throughout printing. Robotic speed and extrusion flow were dynamically adjusted in real time to maintain consistent thermal conditions, ensuring strong interlayer adhesion while preventing warping or deformation.</p>\n\n<p>This production exemplifies the potential of large-scale, functional 3D printing for marine applications.</p>"
