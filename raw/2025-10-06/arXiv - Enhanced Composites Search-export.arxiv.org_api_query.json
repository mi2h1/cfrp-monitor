    "summary": "This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming\n(DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems\ngoverned by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space\ninto domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic\nprogramming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early\nevolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population\ncooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical\nsymbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all\npopulations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to\nidentify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic\nconstructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided\npruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic\nprogramming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete\n(SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation,\nand 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and\ntest root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed\nstatistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error\ndistributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in\nvalidation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that\ndomain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve\nconvergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable\nmodeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the\nunderlying physical structure.",

    "summary": "Engineering educational curriculum and standards cover many material and\nmanufacturing options. However, engineers and designers are often unfamiliar\nwith certain composite materials or manufacturing techniques. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) could potentially bridge the gap. Their capacity to store and\nretrieve data from large databases provides them with a breadth of knowledge\nacross disciplines. However, their generalized knowledge base can lack\ntargeted, industry-specific knowledge. To this end, we present two LLM-based\napplications based on the GPT-4 architecture: (1) The Composites Guide: a\nsystem that provides expert knowledge on composites material and connects users\nwith research and industry professionals who can provide additional support and\n(2) The Equipment Assistant: a system that provides guidance for manufacturing\ntool operation and material characterization. By combining the knowledge of\ngeneral AI models with industry-specific knowledge, both applications are\nintended to provide more meaningful information for engineers. In this paper,\nwe discuss the development of the applications and evaluate it through a\nbenchmark and two informal user studies. The benchmark analysis uses the Rouge\nand Bertscore metrics to evaluate our model performance against GPT-4o. The\nresults show that GPT-4o and the proposed models perform similarly or better on\nthe ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. The two user studies supplement this\nquantitative evaluation by asking experts to provide qualitative and open-ended\nfeedback about our model performance on a set of domain-specific questions. The\nresults of both studies highlight a potential for more detailed and specific\nresponses with the Composites Guide and the Equipment Assistant.",

However, engineers and designers are often unfamiliar\nwith certain composite materials or manufacturing techniques. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) could potentially bridge the gap. Their capacity to store and\nretrieve data from large databases provides them with a breadth of knowledge\nacross disciplines. However, their generalized knowledge base can lack\ntargeted, industry-specific knowledge. To this end, we present two LLM-based\napplications based on the GPT-4 architecture: (1) The Composites Guide: a\nsystem that provides expert knowledge on composites material and connects users\nwith research and industry professionals who can provide additional support and\n(2) The Equipment Assistant: a system that provides guidance for manufacturing\ntool operation and material characterization. By combining the knowledge of\ngeneral AI models with industry-specific knowledge, both applications are\nintended to provide more meaningful information for engineers. In this paper,\nwe discuss the development of the applications and evaluate it through a\nbenchmark and two informal user studies. The benchmark analysis uses the Rouge\nand Bertscore metrics to evaluate our model performance against GPT-4o. The\nresults show that GPT-4o and the proposed models perform similarly or better on\nthe ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. The two user studies supplement this\nquantitative evaluation by asking experts to provide qualitative and open-ended\nfeedback about our model performance on a set of domain-specific questions. The\nresults of both studies highlight a potential for more detailed and specific\nresponses with the Composites Guide and the Equipment Assistant."

Furthermore, its synthesis is significantly simpler and\nmore efficient compared to other studies on porous MXene composites. The\npresented study focuses on a fundamental investigation of the synthesized\nMXene/PNIPAAm composite's properties. Thereby, the fabrication and comparison\nof pure MXene and composite samples featuring either a compact or a highly\nporous three-dimensional microstructure, reveal unique properties with respect\nto: (i) controllable three-dimensional spatial arrangement of MXene instead of\nthe prevalent stacked-sheet structure, (ii) reduction of oxidation-induced\ndegradation of MXene and substantially enhanced stability over the course of\nthree months, and (iii) tunable electronic states in response to gas\ninteractions. Material characterization is conducted by scanning electron\nmicroscopy and rheology to assess the microstructural and mechanical\nproperties, and in a chemiresistive measurement setup for determination of\nelectrical properties and the evaluation of the composite's potential for VOC\nsensing in a gaseous environment with the test analyte acetone.

However, the large-scale\ndeployment of UGW-based ML methods is constrained by data scarcity and limited\ngeneralisation across different materials and sensor configurations. To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM.",

To address\nthese limitations, this work proposes a novel transfer learning (TL) framework\nbased on Multilinear Principal Component Analysis (MPCA). First, a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for regression is trained to perform damage\nlocalisation for a plated structure. Then, MPCA and fine-tuning are combined to\nhave the CNN work for a different plate. By jointly applying MPCA to the source\nand target domains, the method extracts shared latent features, enabling\neffective domain adaptation without requiring prior assumptions about\ndimensionality. Following MPCA, fine-tuning enables adapting the pre-trained\nCNN to a new domain without the need for a large training dataset. The proposed\nMPCA-based TL method was tested against 12 case studies involving different\ncomposite materials and sensor arrays. Statistical metrics were used to assess\ndomains alignment both before and after MPCA, and the results demonstrate a\nsubstantial reduction in localisation error compared to standard TL techniques.\nHence, the proposed approach emerges as a robust, data-efficient, and\nstatistically based TL framework for UGW-based SHM."

By\nmeasuring and modeling the stationary flow that develops around the vane, we\ndeduce the effective friction coefficient of the material from the torque\nmeasured on the vane. Following this approach, we investigate the effect of the\nfiber volume fraction and the aspect ratio on the effective friction\ncoefficient of the grain-fiber mixture.

While a number of methods have been introduced for processing large\nthree-dimensional images in order to generate secondary data, there are only a\nfew techniques available for simple and intuitive visualization of such data in\ntheir entirety. This work employs the AccuStripes visualization technique for\nthat purpose, which enables the visual analysis of secondary data represented\nby an ensemble of univariate distributions. It supports different schemes for\nadaptive histogram binnings in combination with several ways of rendering\naggregated data and it allows the interactive selection of optimal visual\nrepresentations depending on the data and the use case.

However, there are two main sources of\ncomplexity in THz spectral measurements that have resulted in reduced accuracy\nand high uncertainty in the determination of coating thicknesses. These factors\ninclude: 1. The need for \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the complex index of\nrefraction of each coating layer, and 2. The complex and polarization-sensitive\nreflectivity of samples with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates.\nIn this paper, we propose a combined hardware and software solution to address\nthese two limitations. We employ the polarimetric version of our Portable\nHAndheld Spectral Reflection (PHASR) Scanner and use a novel training model on\ntime-of-flight measurements obtained by sparse deconvolution of the THz\ntime-domain pulses. Our method does not depend on separate measurement of the\nindex of refraction of the coating layers; rather, it relies on a physics-based\nlinear model, trained using a small subset of the sample data. We show that\nthickness measurements with mean square error of about 10 $\\mu$m and accuracy\nof more than 92\\% can be achieved when the useful bandwidth of the scanner is\nlimited to about 1.5 THz using photoconductive antenna emitters and detectors.\nWe show that the anisotropic response of the carbon fiber bundles and the weave\npattern structure of the substrate can significantly influence the accuracy of\nthe coating measurement, and therefore a polarimetric imaging approach should\nbe used for inspection of similar samples.",

    "summary": "Partial replacement of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)\noften optimizes their functionalities, however, accurate characterization of\ntheir molar ratios in many cases is challenging. This work presents a method of\ndetermining such linker ratios via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility\nof small quantities of powdered samples. The main presumption is taking the\ndiamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility\nof the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are\nprovided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs\nare either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the\nfollowing systems:\n[MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_{\\delta}$,\n[EuMOF]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[EuPDCA]$_{\\delta}$,\n[UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[UiO-66]$_{\\delta}$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F\nFree]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_{\\delta}$, where 1-$\\delta$ : $\\delta$ are\nthe ratios to be determined.

      "value": "Partial replacement of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)\noften optimizes their functionalities, however, accurate characterization of\ntheir molar ratios in many cases is challenging. This work presents a method of\ndetermining such linker ratios via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility\nof small quantities of powdered samples. The main presumption is taking the\ndiamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility\nof the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are\nprovided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs\nare either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the\nfollowing systems:\n[MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_{\\delta}$,\n[EuMOF]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[EuPDCA]$_{\\delta}$,\n[UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[UiO-66]$_{\\delta}$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F\nFree]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_{\\delta}$, where 1-$\\delta$ : $\\delta$ are\nthe ratios to be determined.

Our framework\nemploys three implicit neural fields to represent geometric shape, layer\nsequence, and fiber orientation. This enables the direct formulation of both\ndesign and manufacturability objectives - such as anisotropic strength,\nstructural volume, machine motion control, layer curvature, and layer thickness\n- into an integrated and differentiable optimization process. By incorporating\nthese objectives as loss functions, the framework ensures that the resultant\ncomposites exhibit optimized mechanical strength while remaining its\nmanufacturability for filament-based multi-axis 3D printing across diverse\nhardware platforms. Physical experiments demonstrate that the composites\ngenerated by our co-optimization method can achieve an improvement of up to\n33.1% in failure loads compared to composites with sequentially optimized\nstructures and manufacturing sequences.",

    "summary": "Magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) are composite materials comprising an\nelastomer matrix with embedded magnetic particles, endowing the composite with\ncoupled effective magneto-mechanical responses. It is widely reported that\nanisotropic MAEs exhibit much stronger magneto-mechanical coupling than\nisotropic MAEs. However, most efforts to model effective magneto-mechanical\nproperties of MAEs via homogenization focused on isotropic microstructures or\nthose with large separations between particles, to use analytical solutions. In\nthis work, we introduce a periodic homogenization approach to compute effective\nmagneto-mechanical properties of anisotropic MAEs, and analyze microstructural\nfeatures that enhance the magneto-mechanical coupling. Using the finite element\nmethod, we numerically determine the effect of particle shape, gap, and voids\non the effective stiffness, permeability, and magneto-mechanical coupling\ntensors for chain-like periodic microstructures. Using insights gained from the\nfull-field simulations, we derive an analytical expression for the\nmagneto-mechanical coupling in the chain direction, in terms of the volume\nfraction, gap size, and properties of the matrix and particles. Results show\nthat the overall magnetostriction of anisotropic MAEs is most sensitive to the\ngap between particles and the waviness of the particle chains, with smaller gap\nsizes and straighter chains yielding higher overall magnetostriction.\nSimulations also show that while isotropic MAEs elongate in a uniform magnetic\nfield, anisotropic MAEs contract with much larger strain amplitudes, a result\nof the attractive forces between particles being much stronger in anisotropic\nMAEs than in isotropic MAEs. Results provide fundamental insights into the\nmechanisms that govern magneto-mechanical coupling in anisotropic MAEs, and\nconstitute a toolbox of homogenized MAE material properties.",

We extended a FF for TNT\nand recasted it in a form that can be readily combined with a well-established\nFF for HMX. The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental\nresults and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined\nTNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate\nthat there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in\nTNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural\nenvironments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal\nloading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are\neffective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that\nTNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond\ntimescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with\nsurface and interface energy.

    "summary": "Recently, there has been an interest in the incorporation of buckypaper (BP),\nor carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes, in composite laminates. Research has shown\nthat using BP in contrast to nanotube doped resin enables the introduction of a\nhigher CNT weight fraction which offers multiple benefits including higher\npiezo resistivity for health monitoring applications and enhanced mechanical\nresponse for structural applications. However, their impact on the deformation\nand failure mechanisms of composite laminates has not been investigated\nthoroughly. Understanding these issues experimentally would require a carefully\nexecuted test plan involving a multitude of design parameters such as BP\ngeometry and placement, material anisotropy and variability, and laminate\nstacking sequence. This paper presents a deep learning (DL)-based surrogate\nmodel for studying the mechanical response of hybrid carbon fiber reinforced\npolymer (CFRP) composite laminates with BP interleaves under various mechanical\nloads. The surrogate model utilizes a long short-term memory architecture\nimplemented within a DL framework and predicts the laminate global response for\na given configuration, geometry, and loading condition. The DL framework\ntraining and cross-validation are performed via data acquisition from a series\nof three-point bend tests conducted through finite element analysis (FEA) and\nin-house experiments, respectively. The model predictions show good agreement\nwith FEA simulations and experimental results, where CFRP with two BP\ninterleaves showed enhanced flexural strength and modulus over pristine\nsamples. This enhancement can be attributed to the excellent crack retardation\ncapabilities of CNTs, particularly in the interlaminar region.",

Herein, we report a strategy to synthesize\nsolvophilic surface-engineered nanoparticles demonstrating its capability to\ncontrol the flow property of chemically distinct liquids like silicone oil and\npolyethylene glycol. Silylated polyether amine-modified silica nanoparticles\nwith polymer brush-like structure were selected as the model synthesized\nmaterial. By combining rheological experiments with coarse-grained molecular\ndynamic (CGMD) simulations, we demonstrate that adding these grafted\nnanoparticles significantly impacts the viscosity of both liquids. The impact\nof grafting density on the rheological properties was also corroborated.\nSimulations indicate the formation of a diverse array of nanoparticle\nmicrostructures, including contact aggregates, bridged aggregates, and\none-dimensional string-like structures that dictate the viscosity of the\nmaterial. Furthermore, we show that copolymers with predominantly\nmatrix-compatible moieties facilitate the intercalation of matrix molecules\nwithin the polymer brushes, enhancing interactions at the molecular level.

The analysed medium is\ndefined as a two-component system consisting of a continuous fiber framework\nwith hydrogel inclusions arranged periodically throughout. The fibers are\nassumed to operate under quasi-stationary linear elasticity, whereas the\nhydrogel's hydromechanical behavior is represented using Biot's linear\nporoelasticity model. The asymptotic limit of the coupled system is established\nwhen the periodicity and thickness parameters are of the same order and tend to\nzero simultaneously, utilizing the re-scaling unfolding operator. It is\ndemonstrated that the limit displacement exhibits Kirchhoff-Love-type behavior\nusing the decomposition of plate displacements. Towards the end, a unique\nsolution for the macroscopic problem has been demonstrated.",
