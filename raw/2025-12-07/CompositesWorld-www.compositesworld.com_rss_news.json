It offers industry access to pre-commercial-scale production and testing, as well as expertise in hydrocarbon processing and carbon fiber&nbsp;development. </p>\n\n<p>Carbon fiber&nbsp;is made with petroleum-based products that are exported, but its price is currently prohibitive. Alberta Innovate believes that a version derived from&nbsp;Canadian bitumen has the potential to reduce the cost of carbon fiber&nbsp;production, and as a result, unlock new applications for its use.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At Alberta Innovates, we don&rsquo;t just see carbon fiber&nbsp;as a material &mdash;&nbsp;we see it as a catalyst,&rdquo; says Alberta Innovates CEO Mike Mahon. &ldquo;A conduit for cleaner energy, smarter design and resilient systems. It&rsquo;s where science meets sustainability.&rdquo; By using bitumen for high-value applications, Alberta has the potential to expand the material&rsquo;s opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The facility&rsquo;s first clients will be the <a href=\"https://albertainnovates.ca/funding/carbon-fibre-grand-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">finalists of the Alberta Innovates Carbon Fibre Grand Challenge</a> (CFGC), a $20 million competition to accelerate the development of production for carbon fiber&nbsp;from bitumen-derived feedstocks and promote their use in manufactured products.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One of the main challenges innovation faces is the gap between laboratory research and commercialization, often due to the lack of pilot-scale infrastructure,&rdquo; says Yasmine Abdin, president and COO, Fibernx, a BC-based carbon fiber&nbsp;company that will be relocating to Alberta to be one of the facility&rsquo;s first clients. &ldquo;This facility allows us to validate our current manufacturing processes on a larger scale and identify the adjustments needed for real-life production. It serves as the vital link between research and manufacturing, to enable faster commercialization of carbon fiber technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>For more info on the facility, <a href=\"https://albertainnovates.ca/alberta-carbon-fibre-processing-facility/\" target=\"_blank\">visit this link</a>.</p>"

Contacted&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deproductenmakers.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">De Productenmakers</a>&nbsp;(Eindhoven), Royal3D&rsquo;s task was to adapt the inlet design to the 3D printing manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-DAC-inlet-3Dprinted-min.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"3D printed DAC inlets.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-DAC-inlet-3Dprinted-min.jpeg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Royal3D approached the request using its step-by-step development method, progressing from design, through testing, followed by the actual 3D printing process&nbsp;and finishing with post-processing. First, the team&nbsp;created the parametric production model to ensure adaptability for larger DAC systems in the future without any delay. After the inlet model was ready, Royal3D created&nbsp;a couple of test pieces to validate with De Productenmakers. Followed by its approval, the team produced&nbsp;two inlets for the Carbyon Go unit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the project&rsquo;s challenge was to 3D print an inlet that weighed less than 25 kilograms&nbsp;per unit. The inlet also had to have minimal warping, while still being aesthetically pleasing. Those were the guiding parameters the&nbsp;team had to follow during the 3D printing manufacturing process.</p>\n\n<p>The printing process took 12 hours, followed by post-processing with a specialized coating by the Royal3D team.&nbsp;Enhanced with UV additives, the components offer enhanced durability and resistance to sunlight-induced degradation. In&nbsp;line with Royal3D&rsquo;s values and beliefs, the production process was engineered to minimize material waste; any residual material was shredded and recycled back into raw feedstock, ready for reuse in future prints.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Royal3D&rsquo;s experience project, the lead time was within 3 weeks. The project further proves how 3D printing and sustainability can go hand in hand.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>In September 2025, Carbyon&nbsp;launches its first DAC module, Carbyon Go. Its&nbsp;sorbent has a large surface area, reaching 90% CO<sub>₂</sub> saturation in just 100 seconds. It is reported to capture 3 tons of CO<sub>₂</sub> per year and to be 200 than&nbsp;faster than other&nbsp;solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>"

The publication outlines how manufacturers can embed sustainability into design, production&nbsp;and end-of-life (EOL) management to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance and reliability.</p>\n\n<p>The white paper examines the environmental impact of composites throughout their life cycle. It highlights the industry&rsquo;s reliance on virgin raw materials and the growing determination to address the recycling challenge posed by composites&rsquo; durability. Drawing on examples from industrial-scale recycling initiatives and Exel&rsquo;s internal programs, the paper argues that design choices and efficient production are just as important as EOL processes. It emphasizes the need for transparency, interoperability&nbsp;and shared responsibility across the value chain to close these gaps.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-Exel-whitepaper-physical-copy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Exel Composites white paper physical copy.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-Exel-whitepaper-physical-copy.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Authored by Exel&rsquo;s senior vice president of technology and sustainability, Kim Sj&ouml;dahl, the white paper brings together insight from research and operations teams across Europe and Asia. Sj&ouml;dahl is a longstanding contributor to the European Composites Industry Association (EuCIA) and its European Circular Composites Alliance (ECCA), which work to establish <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/the-ecca-welcomes-160-organizations-begins-composites-circularity-roadmap-development\" target=\"_blank\">unified sustainability standards</a> across the sector.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Circularity begins with design,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Sj&ouml;dahl. &ldquo;The choices made at the start of a product&rsquo;s life determine how easily it can be reused, repurposed&nbsp;or recycled later. Manufacturers must think beyond single products and consider how each decision affects the wider material ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The paper outlines Exel&rsquo;s own life cycle approach as an example of how industry ambition can translate into measurable change. Initiatives include a <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/exel-composites-fairmat-sign-carbon-fiber-scrap-repurpose-deal\" target=\"_blank\">partnership with Fairmat</a> to recycle carbon fiber waste through low-energy robotic cutting, and collaborations with Alta Performance Materials and Owens Corning to integrate bio-based and recycled raw materials into manufacturing. Exel&rsquo;s Finnish facilities now use exclusively renewably produced electricity, divert more than 99%&nbsp;of waste from landfill and reintroduce hundreds of tons of recovered material into production annually.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the report addresses one of the industry&rsquo;s most persistent challenges:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/trends-fueling-the-composites-recycling-movement\" target=\"_blank\">how to achieve recycling at scale</a>. Cement co-processing remains the most commercially viable recycling route for composites, but more opportunities are developing all the time. Competing interests risk turning advocates for recycling methods like pyrolysis and solvolysis into rival camps, slowing collective progress toward circularity. Rather than setting these approaches against one another, Sj&ouml;dahl envisions a common direction in which established and emerging technologies evolve together.</p>\n\n<p>Sj&ouml;dahl concludes,&nbsp;&ldquo;Circularity will not be achieved through competition but through coordination. Every actor across the value chain has a role to play. By sharing data, aligning goals&nbsp;and combining expertise, the composites industry can move faster toward a sustainable future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>View the white paper <a href=\"https://ideas.exelcomposites.com/whitepaper-sustainability-in-the-composites-industry\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"

The work has continued across Gurit&rsquo;s epoxy formulated range, with alternatives now available for most of the affected Gurit products.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Gurit solutions have not affected cost or performance, a result which has been well received by customers, for whom it has been business-as-usual, with minimal impact on product qualification status.</p>\n\n<p>The following Gurit products are not classified as CMR and are available immediately:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ampreg 32 (alternative to Ampreg 30) and Ampreg 33 (alternative to Ampreg 31) laminating systems</li>\n\t<li>Ampreg 32/33 Thixotropic Pregel</li>\n\t<li>Spabond 730, Spabond 575 (alternative to Spabond 570), Spabond 5 minute and BondPro 200 Series adhesives</li>\n\t<li>Ampro multipurpose system</li>\n\t<li>S-Fair 700 filling and fairing compound.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gurit&rsquo;s response to the changes is aligned with the company&rsquo;s global chemical safety strategy. The team continually monitors the regulatory landscape for early warnings of possible reclassifications and diligently works to reduce the number of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs), high hazard and CMR substances used in formulations and at production sites. The situation remains dynamic with new reclassifications occurring every year, resulting in an ever-growing SVHC list. Chemical safety and product performance are always front-of-mind for the Gurit team. By proactively testing, researching and developing alternatives, they ensure that customers can continue to access safer and high performing epoxy products.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Protecting our colleagues, our customers&nbsp;and the end users of our products is a responsibility we take seriously, and we&rsquo;re committed to staying ahead of regulatory change,&rdquo; adds Amy Moram, chemical compliance manager and sustainable products lead, Gurit. &ldquo;By continually reformulating and improving our chemistry, we ensure the composite market can rely on materials that are not only high-performing but also free from chemicals of concern.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Supply chain communication of the EU&rsquo;s&nbsp;classifications began this year, with harmonized classification expected to become legally binding for some substances from 2026.</p>"

They enable&nbsp;controls to be built into 3D panels of any shape so users can find the right function by touch alone. This offers a safer option than touchscreens in vehicles as it allows drivers to keep their eyes on the road, and it is more slick and hygienic than buttons, as well as being cheaper to produce.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy&rsquo;s technology works with any standard plastic and or glass surface and can incorporate vibrations or voice feedback.&nbsp;It uses standard manufacturing processes which keeps costs down and is highly recyclable. It also works in the presence of liquids which make it suitable for marine cockpits or domestic hobs and washing machines.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Introducing smart surfaces to composite structures</h3>\n\n<p>Manufacturers are increasingly moving away from touchscreens in favor of physical controls, due to safety concerns in the car industry and complaints about malfunctions in appliances and smart devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But adding touch-interactive surfaces to composite structures can force uncomfortable compromises. The fundamental problem with capacitive touch sensing depends on predictable electromagnetic field behavior, and composites can inhibit this.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy has developed an optical waveguide approach to surface sensing that sidesteps this problem. Operating via frustrated total internal reflection at 950 nanometers, the technology is electrically indifferent &mdash; conductivity, permittivity and EMI environments simply don&rsquo;t participate in the sensing mechanism. It functions on the curved surfaces composites naturally produce, operates reliably with gloved hands and wet conditions typical of composite applications, and delivers 3D touch data including contact pressure and finger orientation.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy believes there could be an opportunity for collaboration to develop intelligent structures&nbsp;without sacrificing form or function, hitherto difficult with capacitive touch sensing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The technology has already been successfully trialed by Hyundai and Grupo&nbsp;Antolin, which are now exploring ways to incorporate it into their vehicles. The fresh investment will now enable Uniphy to develop its own integrated chip in preparation for mass manufacturing and miniaturize its technology for use in mobile applications.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy was founded by microelectronics experts David Lomas and David Dean in 2015. The company, which is based in Leeds with an R&amp;D&nbsp;center&nbsp;in Swindon, now employs 15 staff and expects to create five new jobs in the year ahead. The latest round brings the total it has raised to date to more than&nbsp;&pound;13 million.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As humans we spend much of our lives interacting with machines &mdash;&nbsp;on our mobiles, in our cars or our homes &mdash;&nbsp;but the limitations of current controls can make it a frustrating experience,&rdquo; says Jim Nicholas, CEO of Uniphy. &ldquo;Uniphy&rsquo;s technology offers designers the freedom to create new, more intuitive interfaces and transform the way we engage with machines.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund II (NPIFII) covers the entire North of England. Its purpose is to drive sustainable economic growth by supporting innovation and creating local opportunity for new and growing businesses.</p>"
