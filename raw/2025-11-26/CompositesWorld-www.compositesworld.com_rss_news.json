The results from the mission will shed light on what happens when black holes collide and provide insight into the origins of the universe&nbsp;immediately after the Big Bang.</p>\n\n<p>ATG will design the central tube (the chassis of the satellite) based on its patented lightweight, high-stiffness, grid-stiffened structural composite architecture, while &Eacute;ireComposites&nbsp;will manufacture and assemble the structure. This work will encompass everything from the manufacture of test components and structural assemblies to autoclave curing, bonding&nbsp;and precision machining. Detailed inspections will be carried out to make sure each part meets strict aerospace standards, using nondestructive testing and dimensional checks throughout the build. By combining advanced computational modeling, hands-on manufacturing&nbsp;and meticulous quality control, the partners will deliver reliable, high-performance composite structures that are central to the success of the LISA project.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Nearly everything we know about the universe comes from telescopes,&rdquo; says Tomas Flanagan. &ldquo;LISA provides a completely different approach by focusing on gravitational waves instead of light. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that we&rsquo;ll be making structural carbon fiber&nbsp;components for the largest machine that humanity has ever built and that we will be seeking evidence to support Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity.&rdquo;</p>"

The partnership will focus on the development, testing&nbsp;and potential integration of Archer&rsquo;s electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft <em>Midnight</em> into RSG&rsquo;s operations as one of the first deployments of eVTOL aircraft in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>The signing is a step toward the&nbsp;Kingdom&rsquo;s efforts to explore and integrate eVTOL aircraft into its emerging mobility ecosystem. In the agreement&rsquo;s initial phase,&nbsp;Archer Aviation will work together with THC and RSG to build the foundational framework for planned eVTOL operations in Saudi Arabia. This includes establishing a structured sandbox environment to conduct test flights with <em>Midnight</em> under real-world conditions to assess aircraft performance, operational feasibility, regulatory alignment, passenger acceptance and overall ecosystem readiness. Partners will also collaborate on testing advanced aerial technologies, exploring long-term strategic partnerships for large-scale deployment&nbsp;and supporting regional innovation to advance aviation systems.</p>\n\n<p>As the framework progresses, RSG will lead the sandbox testing with Archer&rsquo;s aircraft to evaluate the potential for integrating eVTOL aircraft into the company&rsquo;s future operations. Given RSG&rsquo;s controlled airspace, sustainable infrastructure&nbsp;and its position as a flagship developer under PIF, it offers a suitable platform to demonstrate the potential of advanced air mobility in supporting regenerative tourism and next-generation transportation options for the Kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>According to Archer Aviation&rsquo;s founder and CEO, Adam Goldstein, &ldquo;A key part of Archer&rsquo;s strategy is partnering with the leading operators in each country who share our goals and vision, and both THC and RSG are similarly committed to ensuring that Saudi Arabia is operationally prepared to launch eVTOL aircraft. We look forward to working together to demonstrate how Archer&rsquo;s <em>Midnight </em>aircraft can transform travel within the Kingdom and set a regional benchmark for the future of aviation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Following the completion of the sandbox program, all parties will review the results and consider further initiatives to support large-scale introduction of eVTOL services.</p>"

Located in Daejeon, the heart of the nation&rsquo;s R&amp;D ecosystem, the facility will serve as a dedicated center&nbsp;for collaborative research and innovation, solidifying Korea&rsquo;s role as a strategic technology partner.</p>\n\n<p>The Airbus Tech Hub will focus on three key research pillars leveraging Korea&rsquo;s industrial strengths: the development of future energy technologies, advanced lightweight composites&nbsp;as well as next-generation defense and space technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The Airbus Tech Hub in Korea is being established in close collaboration with the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources (MOTIR), and Daejeon Metropolitan City.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;After five decades of successful industrial partnership with Korea, this step to launch the Airbus Tech Hub in Daejeon is a clear signal of our deepening commitment. The Tech Hub allows Airbus to tap into advanced technologies in Korea, which will help fast-track future aircraft technologies and continue to develop Korea as our trusted, long-term partner,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Mark Bentall, head of R&amp;T program&nbsp;at Airbus. Bentall adds that Daejeon, with its concentration of R&amp;D institutes and talent, is the ideal choice, offering&nbsp;&ldquo;the perfect synergy between advanced academia and industrial ambition, making it the essential base for joint development of future technologies that will drive the industry forward.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Airbus&rsquo; substantial industrial presence is anchored by long-standing partnerships with Tier 1&nbsp;suppliers like Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To accelerate the Tech Hub&rsquo;s mission, Airbus signed three memorandums of understanding (MOU) during the launch ceremony.&nbsp;The first MOU, signed with MOTIR, establishes a framework enabling Airbus to swiftly launch research and innovation projects within Daejeon&rsquo;s technology ecosystem.&nbsp;The second MOU, signed with Daejeon City, also outlines a commitment to support and expedite Airbus&rsquo; research and innovation initiatives across the city&rsquo;s technological landscape. The third MOU, with the Korea International Trade Association (KITA), focuses on leveraging KITA&rsquo;s open innovation platform in Korea to source and engage new partners identified based on the Airbus technology focus areas.</p>\n\n<p>Among the projects announced at the launch of the Airbus Tech Hub in Korea, Airbus is partnering with LIG Nex1 to develop space chip antenna technology used for transmitting and receiving communication signals. Separately, Airbus is engaging with EMCoretech to develop active filtering technologies needed for electrification applications to suppress electromagnetic interference.</p>\n\n<p>Airbus&rsquo; relationship with Korea spans more than 50 years, going back to 1974 when Korean Air ordered the original A300B4 widebody aircraft. Since then, the country has become a key customer base and partner across Airbus&rsquo; commercial aircraft, defense, space and helicopter product lines.</p>\n\n<p>Airbus&rsquo; substantial industrial presence is anchored by long-standing partnerships with Tier 1&nbsp;suppliers like Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD). These partners manufacture critical components for Airbus&rsquo; global civil aircraft programs, including wing structures, fuselage assemblies&nbsp;and composite elements for the A320, A330 and A350 families. Numerous Korean SMEs also contribute to the supply chain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Tech Hub is complemented by the recent opening of Airbus&rsquo; wholly owned subsidiary Composite Technology Centre (CTC)&nbsp;in Busan. CTC&rsquo;s new office aims to cooperate with Busan Techno Park in the R&amp;D&nbsp;of advanced composite materials and processes for aerospace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Korea is the fourth addition to Airbus&rsquo; global network of Tech Hubs, joining existing centers in Japan, the Netherlands and Singapore, which are designed to foster collaboration among industry leaders, academia, government agencies&nbsp;and startups to push boundaries of aerospace technology.</p>"

Likewise, the company continues progress toward introducing similar systems in 2026 for the CFM LEAP-1B engines that power Boeing 737 <em>Max&nbsp;</em>aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For LEAP-1A engines, CFM has produced more than 1,200 high-pressure turbine (HPT) durability kits in less than a year since certification in December 2024. This includes new production engines and durability kits delivered to overhaul shops. CFM and its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO)&nbsp;partners and operators have also installed the reverse bleed system (RBS) on nearly 50% of LEAP-1A engines in service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For LEAP-1B engines, CFM expects the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to grant engine-level, part 33 certification for the RBS shortly. CFM is working closely with Boeing to introduce the RBS and HPT durability kit to 737 <em>Max</em>&nbsp;operators in 2026. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With more than 4,000 aircraft delivered to date, CFM LEAP engines have experienced &ldquo;the fastest ramp in commercial aviation history.&rdquo;&nbsp;Advanced technologies like composite fan blades and ceramic matrix composites (CMC) deliver an engine that&rsquo;s 15% more fuel efficient, with 15% lower carbon emissions than prior-generation CFM56 engines. Backed by advanced health monitoring systems and an open MRO ecosystem, CFM LEAP engines offer mature reliability and enable high asset utilization for narrowbody aircraft. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The LEAP engine family is maturing much faster than its predecessor,&rdquo; says Ga&euml;l M&eacute;heust, president and CEO of CFM International. &ldquo;With these updates, we are now refining the hardware to deliver more durability while reducing the maintenance burden for A320neo family operators. As a result, they benefit not only from the efficiency, reliability&nbsp;and utilization LEAP engines deliver, but also from more predictable operations and longer time on wing.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>CFM designed the HPT durability kit to increase time between shop visits, with the ability to more than double time on wing in severe environments. The improved hardware will help bring time between shop visits in line with its predecessor, the CFM56 engine, which has set industry standards for long time on wing. CFM is delivering all new and overhauled LEAP-1A engines with the kit, including engines going through both CFM and premier MRO shops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, CFM designed the RBS to reduce the need for on-wing fuel nozzle replacements and bring maintenance needs in line with CFM56 standards. The company is shipping RBS kits to all CFM shops, approved third-party providers and operators that have completed the required training at one of CFM&rsquo;s four technical education centers in the U.S., France, India&nbsp;and China.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
