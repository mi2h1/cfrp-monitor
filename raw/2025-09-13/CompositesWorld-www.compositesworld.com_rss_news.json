IFP is a fully automated robotic system that places continuous carbon fibers along a pre-calculated path, creating components with complex geometries and tailored mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness. The technology achieves up to 30% lower weight compared to traditional methods. Using advanced automation technologies enables the company to make carbon fiber component production fast, repeatable and scalable. This approach is particularly attractive for high-performance sectors such as automotive, aerospace, industrial machinery&nbsp;and orthopedics. These industries rely on carbon fiber components because they are&nbsp;lightweight and strong, improving efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, extending range or improving durability.</p>\n\n<p>As Holy Technologies prepared for its first serial production run, the company faced the challenge of establishing a reliable system for real-time scheduling as well as traceability of molds, tools&nbsp;and components. In addition, the team sought a digital backbone flexible enough to support both current production needs and future growth.</p>\n\n<p>To address these requirements, Holy Technologies selected Plataine&rsquo;s AI-powered&nbsp;Production Scheduler. The solution optimizes workstation loads and shift planning, enables predictive maintenance alerts for tools and molds, and delivers real-time quality monitoring to reduce rework and support compliance. Holy Technologies engineering and operations teams will now benefit from real-time visibility into production, empowering them to make data-driven decisions and streamline workflows.</p>\n\n<p>With Plataine, Holy Technologies expects to significantly reduce planning efforts, improve on-time delivery, drive better longer-term procurement and staffing decisions and enable scalable and traceable operations as volumes increase. The result is a robust digital foundation that supports both current efficiency and long-term growth.</p>"

It is expected that the DIP financing facility will be comprised of up to&nbsp;$27.5 million&nbsp;in new money to support the company&rsquo;s day-to-day operations and up to&nbsp;$55 million&nbsp;rolled up from the company&rsquo;s existing senior secured credit facility, underscoring Oaktree&rsquo;s continued support for and confidence in the company.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Over the past several months, we have implemented strategic measures to fortify our business. These deliberate steps were designed to strengthen our financial stability and ensure we remain well-positioned to provide long-term benefits to our customers, suppliers, partners&nbsp;and associates,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Bill Siwek, CEO&nbsp;of TPI. &ldquo;Despite recent progress, industry-wide pressures have created financial challenges that must be addressed. We explored a variety of alternatives to address the challenges facing the company and believe that a chapter 11 process is necessary to position TPI for success.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Siwek says the company aims to reach agreement with stakeholders on the terms of a plan of reorganization for the company in order to right-size its balance sheet and go forward with the ability to compete successfully in the current economic environment. &ldquo;Doing so will provide access to new liquidity to continue our operations and invest in innovation, ensuring our customers can continue to count on TPI for leading-edge wind blade solutions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The company is grateful to its associates for&nbsp;their dedication in continuing to deliver outstanding service, and to TPI customers, suppliers, service providers and other stakeholders for their steadfast support during this restructuring.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout this process and moving forward, TPI will continue operating normally and does not expect any material operational impact from the chapter 11 proceedings. The company will continue to work closely with its customers and suppliers, including by continuing to operate its manufacturing sites and delivering blade services.</p>"

Development of composite specifications, design data and a methodology for certification acceptable to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will enable the adoption of this high-performance, low-cost, high-rate preform and part manufacturing by commercial airframe builders and will aid in its adoption into military platforms.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Together, we are using feedback from specific aerospace primes to create preliminary design values for matrix systems, which will accelerate the process for full qualification and certification.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/hawthorn-composites\" target=\"_blank\">Hawthorn Composites</a> (Miamisburg, Ohio, U.S.) is currently producing inlet ducts&nbsp;for the Kratos XQ-58A <em>Valkyrie</em> using this overbraid and resin infused approach. Hawthorn has manufactured full-scale wings and fuselages for the same vehicle using similar approaches under the Design for Manufacture of Attritable Aircraft Primary Structure program (DMAAPS) program that culminated with a successful full-scale ground vehicle static test conducted by the AFRL. Independent analysis conducted by the AFRL concluded that use of braiding and overbraiding techniques on these types of parts would result in 57% cost savings when compared to hand applied prepreg and autoclave cure, and a 67% reduction in touch time.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Net-shape braided preforms and overbraiding are both key technologies enabling the U.S. Department of Defense&nbsp;to realize their vision of affordable mass aircraft solutions,&rdquo; notes&nbsp;Tom Margraf, CEO of&nbsp;Hawthorn Composites.</p>\n\n<p>Overbraiding creates a controlled and predictable fiber change along the length of a part, including those with complex curvatures. Changing angles create mechanical property variation, but the controlled architecture allows for prediction of property change and creation of design envelopes.</p>\n\n<p>The design of a composite combat drone inlet duct produced by NIAR, A&amp;P Technology&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/fiber-dynamics\" target=\"_blank\">Fiber Dynamics</a> (Wichita, Kan., U.S.) will be used as the basis for the certification development. The complex curvature of the duct represents the types of aircraft structures that will require a path to FAA certification to take advantage of the high rate of manufacture benefits by overbraiding. A process is now in place that enables production of multiple duct preforms per shift, which opens a path to certification and adoption, according to officials from A&amp;P Technology and NIAR.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The overbraided serpentine inlet duct we developed under the MASC program is an excellent example of our partners&rsquo; capabilities and shows how modern braided composite technologies can advance aerospace innovation,&rdquo; says Dr. Waruna Seneviratne, director of NIAR&rsquo;s Advanced Technology Lab for Aerospace Systems (ATLAS). &ldquo;Together, we are using feedback from specific aerospace primes to create preliminary design values for matrix systems, which will accelerate the process for full qualification and certification.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to collaborate with Hexcel on this initiative,&rdquo; says Andy Head, president of A&amp;P Technology. &ldquo;Our combined technologies offer a compelling solution for OEMs looking to quickly and consistently lay down fiber on complex load paths in complex geometries. This program will validate that the resulting structures are as easy to model and certify as incumbent, rate-limiting solutions.&rdquo;</p>"

Serving major global renewable energy OEMs for more than&nbsp;a decade, this strategically positioned site &mdash; just a few miles from the U.S. border &mdash;enhances DFS Composites&rsquo; ability to deliver rapid response, efficiency and reduced lead times to the North American market.</p>\n\n<p>The facility spans approximately 300,000 square feet&nbsp;and supports advanced composites manufacturing processes, including a CNC machine (31 &times; 8 &times; 5 meters), a specialist paint booth, multiple overhead cranes, a dedicated composites and tooling center, in-house AWS-certified welders, and in-house glass fiber cutting and kitting machines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With this new acquisition and existing factories in the U.K., India&nbsp;and China, DFS Composites is now strategically positioned in key locations close to major global customers while enabling the company to meet increasing demand from the U.S., Mexico&nbsp;and South America. This geographic proximity ensures lower logistics costs, greater competitiveness&nbsp;and faster delivery times, and significantly enhances DFS Composites&rsquo; production capacity.</p>\n\n<p>This announcement comes alongside another major milestone this year: DFS Composites was selected among five companies by the Offshore Wind Growth Partnership (OWGP) as part of its inaugural Manufacturing Facility Support Programme (MFSP). The company received a portion of the &pound;1.4 million funding awarded to support the development and expansion of U.K.-based manufacturing facilities for offshore wind components &mdash; reinforcing DFS Composites&rsquo; growing role in industrial-scale renewable energy production.</p>\n\n<p>DFS Composites is exhibiting at&nbsp;CAMX 2025, where it will showcase its expanded capabilities and discuss new collaboration opportunities with North American customers and partners.</p>"
