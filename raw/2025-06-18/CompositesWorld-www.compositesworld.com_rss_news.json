The composite&nbsp;cables are capable of doubling&nbsp;the capacity of existing power lines quickly. In contrast, building new, traditional lines typically takes over a decade and requires significant investment.</p>\n\n<p>Increasing transmission capacity is also essential to meet the growing global demand for electricity and to connect new renewable energy sources (such as solar and wind) in support of decarbonization efforts. HVCRC cables achieve a 30% reduction in electrical losses, enhanced grid resilience to extreme weather events&nbsp;and a reduced risk of wildfires.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;After 40 years of collaboration, including 15 years on composite cores, Epsilon Composite and Toray Carbon Fibers Europe&nbsp;demonstrate the strength of a long-standing, innovative and effective industrial partnership, placing the composites sector at the heart of the global energy transition challenge,&rdquo; says Alexandre LULL, deputy CEO of Epsilon Composite.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0625-cw-news-tennet-grid.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0625-cw-news-tennet-grid.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0625-cw-news-epsilon-composite-core-mfg.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0625-cw-news-epsilon-composite-core-mfg.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Map of the Dutch transmission grid, managed by TenneT (top) and composite core manufacturing in Epsilon Composite&rsquo;s pultrusion workshop (bottom)</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Several thousand kilometers of Epsilon Composite&rsquo;s cable solution has already been installed&nbsp;across the Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and the Americas. The composite core conductors have also recently been selected for&nbsp;several major contracts in Europe. One is from European grid operator TenneT (Arnhem, Netherlands), which selected&nbsp;the HVCRC&nbsp;technology to modernize the entire&nbsp;Dutch 400-kilovolt&nbsp;high-voltage grid until&nbsp;2030.</p>\n\n<p>Following a tender launched in 2024, TenneT selected two European cable manufacturers partnered with Epsilon Composite &mdash;Nexans and DeAngeli Prodotti &mdash; to produce HVCRC&nbsp;conductors. For this tender, the Dutch grid operator challenged suppliers to optimize not only their products but also supply chains and operations to minimize electrical losses and greenhouse gas emissions throughout the product life cycle. TenneT also required a life cycle analysis to assess the environmental impact of the products, integrating this data into the evaluation process.</p>\n\n<p>Epsilon Composite&rsquo;s proactive efforts over the years to assess and optimize the environmental impact of its production and supply chain contributed significantly to this process.</p>\n\n<p>Implementation of the framework agreement has already begun, with two pilot projects underway to qualify HVCRC&nbsp;cables manufactured by Nexans and DeAngeli Prodotti, as well as Epsilon&rsquo;s Corecheck&nbsp;technology, which ensures the integrity of the composite core at every stage of manufacturing and installation. The project is expected to continue until all remaining metallic conductors on TenneT&rsquo;s 400-kilovolt&nbsp;lines are replaced.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are convinced that this HVCRC&nbsp;technology is contributing to the future of electrification in the European and global markets,&rdquo; adds Armin Klesing, marketing and sales director at Toray Carbon Fibers Europe</p>\n\n<p>Both Epsilon Composite and Toray continue to invest in R&amp;D and production capacities to support market growth. Toray Carbon Fibers Europe is completing the construction of a sixth carbon fiber production line, set to be operational by the end of 2025. This new line will further strengthen the company&rsquo;s supply&nbsp;to the&nbsp;European market and guarantee a national supply of the material.</p>"

Source | Dura Composites</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Manufacturer of composite and metal solutions for civil infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/dura-composites\" target=\"_blank\">Dura Composites</a>&nbsp;(Clacton-on-Sea, U.K.) is&nbsp;calling for an urgent rethink of the U.K.&rsquo;s safety regulations relating to decking and cladding for high-rise buildings, and how they are implemented. The company is also putting pressure on industry regulators to enforce tighter rules about fire testing.</p>\n\n<p>According to the company, there is currently a level of confusion surrounding the exact criteria that different products need to comply with for buildings over the height of 11 meters. While cladding requires a classification of A2-s1,d0, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b\" target=\"_blank\">Approved Document B</a> states that for flooring, a classification of A2fl-s1 should be achieved.</p>\n\n<p>However in practice, remedial designers are grouping these two very different products together and requesting an A2-s1d0 fire classification for all. Unless there is an imperforate substrate under it which extends to the full area of the balcony where A2fl-s1 materials are fitted, then A2fl-s1 is allowed.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, Dura Composites has concerns that officials aren&rsquo;t upholding products to regulations stringently enough. Common issues include products not being tested by a UKAS-accredited test facility or in the right orientation, not being tested for the correct field of application, and not being tested in the right color, all of which are stated in the BS EN13501 fire classification standards and can affect the fire-resistance of decking, potentially putting occupants in danger, and leaving those in charge liable.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, some decking providers are circumventing the official UKAS accreditation, by having products tested in other countries with less strict requirements, before transporting them to the U.K.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s looking likely the government won&rsquo;t meet its target to start or complete remedial works on all buildings by July 2027,&rdquo; says Lee Cavalier, decking and cladding manager at Dura Composites. &ldquo;A big factor behind this is the rules themselves, both in terms of clarity over what is required, and actually enforcing these standards. Clearer rules and processes would prevent accidents and be fairer on suppliers, contractors and buyers. When manufacturers aren&rsquo;t clear on the ratings required for their own products, it&rsquo;s no surprise that awareness among housebuilders, developers and contractors is low.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>What should specifiers be asking? Dura Composites says that specifiers can protect themselves by asking the following questions about products, testing and installation for high-rise buildings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Is the certificate provider UKAS-accredited?</li>\n\t<li>Has every component of the product received a fire rating? Different aspects of a product may perform differently, so there should be a fire rating for each individual component.</li>\n\t<li>Do the fire rating and test certificate match the field of application?</li>\n\t<li>Does the installation guide advise on installation methods to match the field of application?</li>\n\t<li>Each product should be installed using a specific method to achieve its stated fire rating.</li>\n\t<li>Has the right orientation been tested? Different orientations may impact the fire rating of the product. Decking products should be tested horizontally, and cladding products should be tested in their intended orientation.</li>\n\t<li>Have all of the available colors been tested? Different colors of a product may impact its fire rating.</li>\n\t<li>Does the fire certificate state which colors are covered, specifically in section 4&nbsp;of the field of application? For example, only a single color is listed followed by &ldquo;no variation allowed.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Uncertainty over regulations isn&rsquo;t the only thing holding up successful remediation work, Dura notes. It was recently announced that the Building Safety Regulator has missed its target to clear the backlog of Gateway 2 approvals by April. While&nbsp;thorough processes are important, this is yet another factor preventing remedial work that is crucial to residents&rsquo; safety.</p>\n\n<p>Dura Composites has submitted its concerns to the Building Safety Regulator and is encouraging other manufacturers to join the cause, asking for more transparency over fire safety standards for high-rise decking and cladding.</p>"

It also presents analyses of global influences and trends in seven world regions that impact the demand for new aircraft. Because of its growing prominence in commercial aviation, statistics for China are detailed separately in this year&rsquo;s market outlook for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>The document also analyzes demand for cargo aircraft, including a forecast for passenger-to-freighter conversions.</p>\n\n<p>The overall forecast for the number of new sub-150-seat aircraft remains almost unchanged from Embraer&rsquo;s previous estimate. Arjan Meijer, Embraer&nbsp;president and CEO of Commercial Aviation, attributes the consistency of the estimate to the longevity of social, supply chain&nbsp;and geopolitical trends Embraer identified during the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Five years after the onset of the pandemic, many of the structural changes it triggered have proven to be quite long-lasting,&rdquo; says Meijer. &ldquo;In our first post-pandemic market outlook, we highlighted the transition from globalization to a more polarized geopolitical outlook. Today, as countries and regions pursue greater strategic autonomy, the demand for regional access will continue to grow. We believe mixed fleets that combine small and large narrowbody aircraft are essential for that long-term growth. They provide the versatility needed to better match capacity with demand, expand networks and support national and regional development goals.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Embraer shares some of the highlights of its 20-year commercial market outlook below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>World passenger traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) is forecast to grow 3.9% annually through 2044. China will lead among seven global regions. The annual RPK regional growth rate is ranked as follows:&nbsp;5.7% China; 4.7% Latin America; 4.4% Africa; 4.4% Middle East; 4.1% Asia Pacific; 3.1% Europe and&nbsp;CIS; 2.4% North America.</li>\n\t<li>The&nbsp;RPK share by the end of 2044: 39% Asia Pacific; 37% Europe and&nbsp;North America.</li>\n\t<li>Global demand for new aircraft with up to 150 seats:&nbsp;10,500 units, 8,720 jets and 1,780 turboprops.</li>\n\t<li>Market value of all new aircraft: $680 billion.</li>\n\t<li>Jet deliveries &mdash;&nbsp;8,720 (% share) &mdash;&nbsp;by region: 2,680 North America (30.7%); 1,990 Europe and&nbsp;CIS (22.8%); 1,500 China (17.2%); 1,050 Asia Pacific (12.1%); 770 Latin America (8.8%); 380 Africa (4.4%); 350 Middle East (4.0%).</li>\n\t<li>Turboprop deliveries &mdash;&nbsp;1,780 (% share) &mdash;&nbsp;by region: 640 Asia Pacific (36.0%); 280 North America (15.7%); 260 Europe and&nbsp;CIS (14.6%); 220 Africa (12.4%); 200 China (11.2%); 160 Latin America (9.0%); 20 Middle East (1.1%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The complete Embraer&nbsp;&ldquo;Market Outlook 2025&rdquo;&nbsp;can be <a href=\"https://embraer.imagerelay.com/fl/678e7f8e728c4876824e5b4b18fef43a\" target=\"_blank\">downloaded here</a>.</p>"
