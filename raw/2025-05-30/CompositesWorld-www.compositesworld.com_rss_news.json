FACC says that the novel testing method is not specifically tied to any material, however, composite materials being the company&rsquo;s main focus, it is clear that the system could be used for these kinds of applications.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the newly developed digital inspection, we are establishing an additional efficient and precise inspection method that offers significant advantages compared to conventional inspection methods,&rdquo; says CEO Robert Machtlinger, emphasizing the added value of the research project for FACC.</p>\n\n<p>With AR, digital information is integrated into the user&rsquo;s environment in real time. This is done using a tablet on which the live image of a component is superimposed with the digital content generated by a software program. The AR software, which was specially developed for industrial applications, projects inspection instructions as digital 3D overlays directly onto the respective test object. &ldquo;By automatically navigating to each inspection point and the mandatory confirmation of conformity, we minimize the risk of errors and deviations,&rdquo; explains Thomas Ecker, program engineer and head of the student project at FACC. &ldquo;This enables us to detect errors at an early stage and ensures product quality.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>According to FACC, the AR-supported solution offers a much faster inspection, especially for large and complex components. The automated documentation of the test results and the structured process improve quality assurance. FACC also sees potential for other areas of application in production and also in maintenance and repair work. The successful company project together with the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria illustrates the potential of practice-oriented research and shows how digitization can be further advanced in the aviation industry.</p>"

Pritzkow Spezialkeramik (WPS)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.keramikblech.com/en/company/\" target=\"_blank\">Walter E.C. Pritzkow Spezialkeramik</a> (WPS, Filderstadt, Germany), a company focused&nbsp;on the develop&shy;ment and design of light&shy;weight struc&shy;tures made of ceramics, has developed a solution in&nbsp;collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/basf-se\" target=\"_blank\">BASF</a> (Ludwigshafen, Germany) consisting of tubes that combine monolithic ceramics with an oxide ceramic matrix composite&nbsp;(OCMC), creating hybrid burner lances that are advancing operations at BASF facilities worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>For decades, petrochemical crackers have faced continuous challenges with metallic burner lances, particularly as hydrogen is increasingly incorporated into processes. The catalytic properties of nickel-based alloys accelerate coking, a damaging carbon buildup that obstructs critical flow passages and leads to overheating, corrosion and ultimately, component failure during removal.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike metal components that require replacement approximately every 6 months, WPS&rsquo; ceramic hybrid burner lances have been operating continuously for more than&nbsp;18 months without issues, with projected service life extending to 10-12 years based on similar operating conditions in other applications.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-burnerlances-h2-walterpritzkow-2.png;maxWidth=385\" /></div>\n\n<p>Close-up of WPS&rsquo; CMC burner lances after 18 months of continuous operation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>According to the company, what makes this solution effective is the application of OCMC&nbsp;where traditional monolithic ceramics would fail. While monolithic ceramics offer the needed chemical inertness, they lack the crack-stopping mechanisms and thermal shock resistance required in cracker environments. Monolithic components would crack during initial heating cycles due to thermal stresses. The combination of the monolithic ceramic with the fiber-reinforced structure of OCMC&nbsp;provides the necessary damage tolerance and thermal shock resistance while maintaining the chemical inertness that makes ceramics ideal for these harsh environments.</p>\n\n<p>This approach delivers multiple benefits to chemical plant operators. First, OCMC components eliminate the catalytic reactions that damage metal parts during operation. They also withstand the high temperatures that occur during decoking processes, which reduces the risk of failure. Additionally, the system incorporates commercially available metal connections that make the ceramic burner lances integrate seamlessly with current systems as a retrofitable solution.</p>\n\n<p>WPS&rsquo;&nbsp;exclusive license for this patented technology by BASF positions the company&nbsp;as the sole provider of this solution. WPS continues to work with BASF to optimize the metal-ceramic connection to simplify the installation process for plant operators.</p>\n\n<p>Walter E.C. Pritzkow Spezialkeramik has more than&nbsp;30 years of experience with OCMC for extreme environments. The company is seeing interest in the technology spreading throughout the petrochemical industry as more companies recognize the potential benefits for their global operations to increase efficiency, reduce maintenance schedules&nbsp;and enable the transition to greener, more sustainable operations.</p>"

This 3-year extension is a notable development,&nbsp;reaffirming Velocity&rsquo;s role in critical defense programs&nbsp;and supporting the&nbsp;company&rsquo;s existing revenue forecasts for fiscal year 2025.</p>\n\n<p>Velocity&rsquo;s core business is centered on providing specialized composite material kits, a service&nbsp;designed to enhance efficiency, reduce internal costs and free up resources for its&nbsp;manufacturing customers. The company achieves this by meticulously managing the entire&nbsp;raw material supply chain. Leveraging proprietary process knowledge and cutting-edge&nbsp;software, Velocity reports that its&nbsp;approach minimizes material waste and optimizes the amount of material needed during the production of complex aircraft components. Its comprehensive offerings include structural material kits and engineered vacuum bag material kits, catering to diverse manufacturing requirements. Digital traceability is integrated throughout the company&rsquo;s process to achieve high-value materials.</p>\n\n<p>Velocity relationship&rsquo;s with this unnamed defense&nbsp;OEM is said to be substantial, dating back to 2010. Under the terms of&nbsp;the renewed contract, Velocity will continue its role in supplying process material kits&nbsp;for major defense projects, specifically existing fourth&nbsp;and fifth generation fighter programs.</p>\n\n<p>This close&nbsp;collaboration involves Velocity teams working directly with its customer on-site,&nbsp;undertaking essential inventory management and contributing to continuous&nbsp;improvement initiatives stipulated within the contract. The agreement also reflects current&nbsp;economic realities, incorporating a&nbsp;necessary price adjustment to account for increased operational costs, including labor, energy and finance, since the previous renewal.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The versatility of Velocity&rsquo;s service model has been one of the criteria for the large order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have been serving world class defense OEM&rsquo;s as key partners for many&nbsp;years, and we are delighted to continue our relationship,&rdquo; says Jon Bridges, CEO of Velocity Composites. &ldquo;Our work&nbsp;with this particular OEM helps to reduce the&nbsp;cost of manufacture.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Bridges also provided insight into Velocity&rsquo;s broader strategic direction within the defense&nbsp;sector. &ldquo;As noted in our recent results, our business development teams are&nbsp;building on existing relationships in defense sector and developing our business case with&nbsp;other defense OEMs in Europe and the U.S.,&rdquo; he says. This&nbsp;proactive approach positions Velocity to&nbsp;capitalize on the increasing global defense expenditure, which Bridges pointed out is&nbsp;currently rising.</p>\n\n<p>The versatility of Velocity&rsquo;s service model has been one of the criteria for the large order. &ldquo;Our services are identical for defense customers who share&nbsp;similar issues to civil aircraft, underscoring Velocity&rsquo;s ability to apply its specialized kitting&nbsp;and supply chain management expertise across different aerospace segments,&rdquo; Bridges explains.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;renewal and strategic focus align with Velocity&rsquo;s recent expansion efforts, including the&nbsp;establishment and <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/velocity-composites-receives-nadcap-accreditation-for-us-facility\" target=\"_blank\">NADCAP&nbsp;accreditation</a> of its first U.S. facility in Alabama. This site is&nbsp;also dedicated to supplying composite material kits for another global aerospace prime, initially for GKN Aerospace.</p>\n\n<p>Recent&nbsp;financial results further support this growth trajectory, showing a significant increase in&nbsp;revenue, particularly driven by U.S. sales following the onboarding of a major manufacturer.</p>"
