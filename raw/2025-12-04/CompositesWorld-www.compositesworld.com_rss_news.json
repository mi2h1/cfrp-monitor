Source | DLR</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Making the next generation of composite structures for space and aviation lighter and more efficient requires rethinking not only the structure, but also the material itself. The <a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/en/bt\" target=\"_blank\">German Aerospace Center (DLR) Institute of Structures and Design</a>&nbsp;(Stuttgart) and the associated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dlr.de/en/zlp/research-transfer/projects/projects-from-augsburg/englisch/nature-sustainable-helicopter-structures-for-environmentally-friendly-aviation\" target=\"_blank\">DLR Centre&nbsp;for Lightweight Production Technology</a> (Augsburg) have recently completed a major milestone with excellent results in the project NATURE, using automated fiber placement (AFP) to manufacture laminates from very thin plies of carbon fiber-reinforced prepreg made with LMPAEK thermoplastic polymer (<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/victrex-plc\" target=\"_blank\">Victrex</a>, Clevelys, U.K.).</p>\n\n<p>The prepreg, produced by <a href=\"https://www.fukuvi.co.jp/en/technology/cfrp\" target=\"_blank\">Fukuvi Chemical Industry Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</a> (Fukui, Japan), features a fiber areal weight (FAW) of only 36 grams per square meter (gsm) and is only 45 microns thick &mdash; so thin that each layer of the laminate has as few as seven fibers in the vertical direction. This is approximately a third of standard carbon fiber/LMPAEK material, meaning three times the design flexibility in deciding how fibers are oriented to achieve maximum performance.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>NATURE project to reduce CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions in aviation</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Funded by the German <a href=\"https://www.bundeswirtschaftsministerium.de/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy </a>(BMWE), this project runs from 2023 to 2026 and focuses on the production of new lightweight helicopter structures and the holistic reduction of CO<sub>₂</sub> emissions across the entire life cycle.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-l m-r-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Fraunhofer IGCV&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.igcv.fraunhofer.de/en/research/reference_projects/LuFo-VI-3_sustainable_helicopter_structure_manufacturing_recyling.html\" target=\"_blank\">highlights</a></h3>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1225-cw-news-nature-fraunhofer.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </div>\n\n<p>Sources | Fraunhofer, LiezDesign -&nbsp;Adobe Stock</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Project partners &mdash; including Airbus Helicopters, Fraunhofer IGCV and&nbsp;Technische Universit&auml;t Dresden (TU Dresden) &mdash; are considering all phases from material production and manufacturing technologies to construction methods, operation and end-of-life processes. This cradle-to-grave approach avoids conflicting effects that could arise from optimizing individual process steps in isolation. The goal is to establish sustainable design principles and manufacturing processes that contribute to a significant reduction in the ecological footprint.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Thin-walled surface structures, innovative joining technologies</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The production of modern carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) components for the aerospace industry involves several energy-intensive process steps, particularly in the drilling and joining of different materials such as metals and adhesives. The resulting structural weight depends heavily on the properties and thickness of the prepreg.</p>\n\n<p>Within the framework of NATURE, the consortium of experts in design, materials science, process engineering and the specific implementation scenario in helicopters are developing an innovative construction method based on thin-walled shell structures with pseudo hollow-profile stiffeners. This design enables significant mass savings without compromising the mechanical integrity of the structure.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1225-cw-news-nature-dlr-welding.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"ultrasonic welding for thermoplastic composites at DLR\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1225-cw-news-nature-dlr-welding.jpeg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Laboratory test bench for continuous ultrasonic welding of high-performance&nbsp;TPC&nbsp;at the DLR ZLP in&nbsp; Augsburg.

The TPC tape laying process is being adapted to enable reliable production of thin, double-curved geometries. In addition, existing TPC joining processes are being evaluated for bio-based and recycled materials.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Process automation, material efficiency via&nbsp;SMC</strong></h3>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1225-cw-news-nature-dlr-smc.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DLR hot press and SMC test plate\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1225-cw-news-nature-dlr-smc.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Hot press at the DLR ZLP in Augsburg is used for&nbsp;SMC processing (<em>left</em>) and&nbsp;SMC test plate for analyzing&nbsp;mold filling behavior (<em>right</em>).

SMC technology enables the cost-effective production of complex structural components that were historically manufactured from metal. The SMC process is fully automatable and characterized by a high potential for functional integration. This opens new possibilities for lightweight construction, offering both ecological and economic advantages.</p>"

An overwhelming 94% of R&amp;D teams reported abandoning at least one project in the past year because the simulations ran out of time or computing resources, leaving potential discoveries unrealized. The findings underscore the industry&rsquo;s urgent need for faster simulation capabilities to keep pace with surging innovation demands.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the economic stakes for accelerating R&amp;D have never been clearer. According to the survey, organizations are saving roughly $100,000 per project on average by leveraging computational simulation in place of purely physical experiments. This proven ROI is driving heavy investment in new tools and workflows. Researchers are also eager to speed up their work even if it means accepting minor trade-offs in precision &mdash; 73% of respondents said they would trade a small amount of accuracy for a 100-times increase in simulation speed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is the quiet crisis of modern R&amp;D: the experiments that never happen,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Daisuke Okanohara, CEO of Matlantis. &ldquo;Our study shows nearly every materials research team has had to leave promising projects on the shelf, not for lack of ideas, but because their tools couldn&rsquo;t keep up. It&rsquo;s a stark wake-up call that traditional trial-and-error methods are too slow and costly for today&rsquo;s pace of innovation. We&rsquo;re at a turning point where the industry must embrace faster, smarter approaches to ensure crucial discoveries don&rsquo;t get left behind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The report also highlights that trust and security remain paramount. Every team surveyed expressed concerns about protecting intellectual property when using external or cloud-based tools, and only 14% felt &ldquo;very confident&rdquo; in the accuracy of AI-driven simulations. In sum, materials scientists are hungry for speed and efficiency, but solutions must also earn their confidence.</p>\n\n<p>For Matlantis, the survey&rsquo;s findings validate the urgency of its mission. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/matlantis-upgrades-universal-atomistic-simulator-for-materials-discovery-opens-dedicated-us-office\" target=\"_blank\">cloud-native Matlantis platform </a>was built to accelerate materials discovery through AI-accelerated, high-speed simulations without compromising on scientific fidelity or data security. By integrating advanced neural-network potentials with proven physics, Matlantis enables researchers to iterate rapidly while maintaining confidence in the results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;At Matlantis, we anticipated this inflection point and designed our platform to deliver acceleration and efficiency without sacrificing accuracy or security,&rdquo; Okanohara says. &ldquo;Our AI technology lets scientists run high-fidelity simulations in hours instead of months, with the assurance that those results can be trusted. As R&amp;D teams race to develop sustainable batteries, catalysts, semiconductors and more, Matlantis is here to ensure they can carry those projects through to breakthrough results rather than abandoning them mid-stream.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The full findings and analysis are detailed in the&nbsp;report, which is available for download on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qb_kKsnXXcOHkE-AmebBYWkJO6q9dvUqoYVh-Ecv1F-dly1Hw8yFHhiwPbEfxxpszdhYxJ5SKeA7KDixEaxdsBDFRRD1eRsW2GQh4n2yf0mvLCgHJcK3sBNlgABUmr5huFFTOXl7fzTPiVxjtqI2OinMBQJkIovH1-jJ4_S5mD9ZhNDZjvI-hF5jTWHTtVvu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Matlantis&rsquo;&nbsp;website</a>.&nbsp;</p>"
