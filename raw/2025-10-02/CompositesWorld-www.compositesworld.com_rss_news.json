In a partnership that has grown over the past 3 years, SGL Carbon and Carbon Cleanup are returning these materials to the loop.</p>\n\n<p>Using CARB-E, automotive carbon fiber scraps are processed with a near-zero carbon footprint (0.036 kg CO<sub>₂</sub> eq. per kilogram). The recycled fibers are then used as reinforcement in injection molding compounds, giving the material a second life while replacing virgin fibers such as glass fiber. Early applications, including a super sports car front hood, has demonstrated a 30% CO<sub>₂</sub> reduction per part compared to the original material used.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The partnership began as a &ldquo;Frontrunnership&rdquo; to test material recyclability and has since scaled significantly. A dedicated logistics system for the recycling program has been developed, and more than&nbsp;50 tons of carbon fiber scraps have already been recycled in 2025. Volumes are expected to triple by the end of the year, marking a milestone for industrial-scale circularity.</p>\n\n<p>Within the partnership, waste audits, digitalizing waste and iteration loops, a smart AI-supported collection system has also been developed to track waste from the point it is generated all the way to the final product or even second-life part.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For the final product, it&rsquo;s key to know exactly where the waste came from. And for material scientists, that data is gold when it comes to creating the right formulations,&rdquo; says Jakob Schlosser, CTO Carbon Cleanup. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why our system makes sure every piece of waste is tracked, traceable&nbsp;and connected across the recycling network.&rdquo;</p>"

The company works with wind farm operators with redundant blades and public bodies&nbsp;looking for low-carbon options for pedestrian bridges, bus shelters, public benches and other solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The Meenadreen blade is the first time BladeBridge has worked on a wind farm amenity project, where the blade will return to its original home to continue its working life in a new form. Aligned to the UN Sustainability Development Goals, and with sustainability at the core of everything it does, Energia commissioned&nbsp;BladeBridge&nbsp;in an effort to enhance the site for walkers on the Leghowney Loop trail, promote the circular economy and raise public awareness of the possibilities and need to repurpose waste materials through sustainable resource management.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n<p>The completed blade project consists of an eye-catching shelter, stylish picnic table structure with seating and standalone benches.&nbsp;Simon Dennehy from Perch Design, BladeBridge&rsquo;s creative director, says he believes in the importance of highlighting blade engineering features in any new form. &ldquo;These&nbsp;blades are amazing, organic, undulating and asymmetric structures and I want to preserve these design aspects so that people will know that they are sitting on, or standing under, something that was once part of a wind turbine, which will now last for many more decades.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The centerpiece of the walkers&rsquo; rest area is the shelter, which is dedicated to one of the engineers who worked on the site,&nbsp;Jimmy Kelly from Carrowbeg in Co. Mayo, who was an Irish wind energy pioneer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Jimmy was a renewable energy expert and enthusiast,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Brian Mullen, head of Energia Renewables Operations. &ldquo;He generated his own electricity at home, was an organic farmer and even made his own Mayo wine. An expert in too many fields to list, Jimmy would no doubt accuse us of making a fuss. However, he&rsquo;d be blown away to see a blade he&rsquo;d worked on transformed and still in use.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>"

In addition, its Flagler Beach, Florida, production facility will be closed and production of models currently manufactured at that facility will be consolidated into the Edgewater, Florida, operation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The decision to transition production out of Reynosa, Mexico &mdash; which is primarily dedicated to manufacturing of our small, value fiberglass boats &mdash; follows our announcement that we have rationalized our value boat model portfolio, and reflects evolving market dynamics that are impacting industry-wide volumes of value fiberglass products,&rdquo; explains&nbsp;Brenna Preisser, president of Brunswick Boat Group. &ldquo;The Reynosa facility and team members have played an important role in our business for many years, and we are committed to supporting their transition. We anticipate the transition will be fully completed by summer 2026.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Reinforcing its broader integration and expansion effort, Brunswick is investing $5 million in capital improvements across its Tennessee and Florida facilities, further strengthening their capabilities as multi-brand production hubs. This investment underscores Brunswick&rsquo;s commitment to leveraging its scale to drive operational synergies. These moves will result in the creation of more than 200 U.S. manufacturing jobs over the next several years.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Brunswick&rsquo;s Boat Group has sufficient capacity within our manufacturing footprint to absorb volume, support future market rebounds and capture share gains from an aggressive product development roadmap,&rdquo; Preisser confirms.&nbsp; &ldquo;With these and other actions taken to streamline our portfolio and improve productivity, the group will achieve a better structural cost profile and accelerate improved profitability.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Brunswick is collaborating closely with local government agencies and economic development partners to support a seamless transition. As Boston Whaler consolidates its production operations in Florida, team members from the Flagler Beach facility will be offered opportunities to transfer to the Edgewater location. In addition, the company will soon launch recruitment efforts to fill new positions across production, logistics, engineering&nbsp;and operations management.</p>"

Throughout this contract, Plana has secured pre-orders for a total of 127 aircraft.</p>\n\n<p>Plana&rsquo;s hybrid eVTOL&nbsp;will use carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for the aircraft airframe and <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/plana-duc-helices-propellers-to-develop-propellers-for-aam\" target=\"_blank\">prop system</a>. It is equipped with a hybrid power management system that simultaneously operates a certified turbogenerator and a battery system. It can carry up to six passengers and is operated by a single pilot, leveraging instrument flight rule (IFR) and simplified vehicle operation (SVO) technology.</p>\n\n<p>The aircraft has a service range of more than&nbsp;300 miles on a single refueling, with a maximum speed of over 350 kilometers per hour. Its all-electric propulsion system reduces noise to 1/100<sup>th</sup> the level of a helicopter, Plana reports,&nbsp;maximizing social acceptance. As a hybrid aircraft, it also has the advantage of being able to use existing infrastructure like helicopter pads.</p>\n\n<p>FAA certification is targeted for end of 2031, with first commercial launch schedued for 2032.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our company, which was launched in South Korea, has now completed the establishment of a Delaware corporation in the U.S. and plans to finalize its headquarters relocation within the&nbsp;year to pursue FAA certification, capital raising&nbsp;and market entry,&rdquo; says Braden J. Kim, founder and CEO of Plana. &ldquo;Vonaer is&nbsp;a highly influential air mobility service platform provider in Asia. Our aircraft will create a much larger market in a sector currently served by helicopters.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Plana previously signed an MOU with Vonaer in May 2023. Since then, the companies have&nbsp;jointly analyzed the data realistically required by the market and collaborated on how to properly shape eVTOL travel.</p>\n\n<p>Vonaer&nbsp;is reported to be Korea&rsquo;s first advanced air mobility (AAM) platform, expanding from helicopter-based services to private jets and eVTOLs. The company is building a hospitality-driven luxury service platform to set the standard for air mobility in Asia and is preparing for expansion into Europe and the U.S.</p>"
