This research aims to enhance the understanding of flow fields in injection box technology, which is increasingly replacing traditional open impregnation baths in the production of lightweight components made of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP). According to the institute, injection boxes improve component quality and increase process productivity, particularly with highly reactive matrix systems.</p>\n\n<p>For lightweight FRP components, reinforcing fibers are continuously impregnated with a plastic matrix in processes such as pultrusion and winding. While previous research investigated geometric influences on backflow in injection boxes and derived design guidelines for the pultrusion process, it did not account for the impact of injection strategy on production speed and product quality. Additionally, the resin residence time resulting from injection box design remains unpredictable.</p>\n\n<p>In this study, IKV uses an impulsive change in the color of the matrix during the pultrusion process to indicate the flow field in the injection box. To analyze the flow field, the profile is cut at regular intervals, and the resulting cross-sections are examined. Each cross-section displays a distinct color distribution based on its temporal proximity to the color change. The temporal variation in color change for each cross-section component is calculated using digital image correlation, facilitating further investigation of the underlying flow fields.</p>\n\n<p>The study suggests that combining insights from injection box geometry, injection strategy&nbsp;and the use of semi-finished textile products offers significant potential to improve impregnation quality and process efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>The first project meeting on this topic will take place at IKV on Sept. 23, 2025. Registration is open, and interested parties are encouraged to contact the institute for further details.</p>\n\n<p>This IGF research project (01IF23502N) of the Research Association for Plastics Processing was funded through the Industrial Collective Research (IGF) program&nbsp;by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), based on a resolution of the German Bundestag. The Institute acknowledges the support of all contributing institutions.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>This post is courtesy of the </em>CompositesWorld<em> and AZL Aachen GmbH media partnership. </em></p>"

The company uses a&nbsp;high-precision, patented Forged Carbon manufacturing process to create robust blades that are complex in shape, with smooth surfaces and&nbsp;thin trailing edges, resulting in increased power, improved efficiency&nbsp;and reduced noise. The company is globally recognized for its commitment to aviation safety, with certifications from the EASA, FAA&nbsp;and other international authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>SkyDrive,&nbsp;</em>featuring a composite body and rotor frames by <a href=\"https://www.carbonmagic.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Toray Carbon Magic</a>&nbsp;(Shiga, Japan), is a&nbsp;multi-rotor eVTOL aircraft propelled by 12 motors and three-bladed rotors. In such multi-rotor eVTOL configurations, the rotors are critically important components that generate lift and thrust, enabling precise control of the aircraft&rsquo;s attitude and movement via individual rotor speed adjustments. This distributed propulsion system also significantly contributes to noise reduction, redundancy&nbsp;and overall flight safety.</p>\n\n<p>By developing and using flight-critical rotors in collaboration with Duc H&eacute;lices Propellers, SkyDrive will accelerate the development and testing of safe aircraft.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Duc H&eacute;lices has already proven to be incredibly agile; leveraging their in-house expertise and partner capabilities, they delivered initial products within 4&nbsp;months,&rdquo; says Arnaud Coville, chief development officer of SkyDrive.&nbsp;&ldquo;These products have achieved strong performance on our test rigs, marking a significant milestone in advancing our aircraft development toward type certification.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>SkyDrive began testing eVTOL prototypes in 2014 prior to official incorporation in 2018. In 2019, SkyDrive&nbsp;flew a&nbsp;crewed eVTOL for the first time. As of 2025, SkyDrive is working with civil aviation authorities in Japan and the U.S. to acquire certification for its product. The eVTOL aircraft is being produced at a facility&nbsp;owned by Suzuki Motor Corp., SkyDrive&rsquo;s official production partner.&nbsp;</p>"

Automated Molding technology enables&nbsp;software users&nbsp;to upload component/part design STEP files into Plyable&rsquo;s&nbsp;machine learning system. Plyable&rsquo;s system computes pull directions, automatically extrudes a shape&rsquo;s boundary and adds elements such as laser targeting holes, to generate a precise STEP file of the mold. The process is 100% computer-driven, producing supplier-ready files in a matter of minutes.</p>\n\n<p>What are the real benefits to using this Automated Molding feature? Plyable says its&nbsp;invention creates even more technological support to aid time-constrained customers. This feature helps with:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Timesavings.&nbsp;</strong>Upload an existing part/component design to receive an instant model. Plyable&rsquo;s&nbsp;mathematical and science-based capabilities enable it&nbsp;to create a bespoke and speedy solution to address getting parts into production effectively.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accuracy. </strong>Plyable<strong>&nbsp;</strong>employs mathematicians, computer scientists&nbsp;and user experience experts to interact constructively with its design engineering team. The combined experience enables the company to&nbsp;build, develop, test and release tools once it is&nbsp;confident&nbsp;they&rsquo;ll deliver.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Learn more: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/plyable-releases-ai-powered-mold-design-tool-\">Plyable&nbsp;releases AI-powered mold design tool</a>&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Reduced risk.</strong>&nbsp;The majority of projects are managed through Plyable&rsquo;s automated digital manufacturing journey without much human intervention. For more complex projects, the group has a composites&nbsp;engineering team on hand to assist with every stage of manufacture; from design to engineering, and from production to logistics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Access to a global supply chain.&nbsp;</strong>When signed up with Plyable, users&nbsp;will have access to more than&nbsp;100 manufacturers, giving businesses more experienced expertise in a niche sector, widening a team&rsquo;s capabilities&nbsp;and providing insight into best practice manufacturing, as well as offering&nbsp;further opportunities to scale business offerings.</p>\n\n<p>Plyable grades&nbsp;and vets every supplier before adding them into the software&rsquo;s network. They must meet IS09001 standards and there are certain Plyable directed competencies they will need to prove before given access to&nbsp;client briefs. Plyable also collaborates&nbsp;with like-minded clients, and feels gaining patents helps protect their trust, faith&nbsp;and direction to the company&rsquo;s mission.</p>"

With an annual capacity of 2,800 tonnes, the facility will become the company&rsquo;s first commercial-scale plant dedicated to the recycling of wind turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p>The financing package consists of a combination of public grants and private capital: an EU Horizon grant awarded in December 2022, two project contributions from Innovation Norway, and a final tranche of NOK 8.6 million (approx. $858,000) through a mix of debt and a share issue that attracted eight local and regional investors. This final step was the decisive piece that completed the company&rsquo;s aforementioned financing package.</p>\n\n<p>Gjenkraft highlights a proprietary pyrolysis technology that is capable of recycling close to 100% of wind turbine blade materials &mdash; including glass fiber, carbon fiber, oils, foams&nbsp;and metals &mdash;&nbsp;turning them into valuable raw materials. The technology delivers significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to incineration, while eliminating the need for landfilling and reducing the extraction of virgin raw materials.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the financing secured, we can now build a commercial production plant that is both economically sustainable and industrially competitive,&rdquo; notes Arvid L&oslash;nne, chairman of Gjenkraft. &ldquo;This provides a solid foundation for further growth in Norway and across Europe.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the H&oslash;yanger facility, Gjenkraft is positioning itself for further expansion across Europe, with ambitions to establish multiple plants and reach a total capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year by 2035.</p>\n\n<p>For related content, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/wind-blade-recycling-project-presents-objectives-progress\">Wind blade recycling project presents objectives, progress</a>&rdquo; or learn more about&nbsp;Gjenkraft on our <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/kc/sustainability/composites-suppliers-resource\" target=\"_blank\">Sustainability page</a>.</p>"

The new name marks the&nbsp;company&rsquo;s transition to a standalone, privately held business and reflects its legacy in lightweight composite solutions.</p>\n\n<p>As part of this transformation, the company has unveiled a new logo (shown above) and is retiring the historical &ldquo;Continental Structural Plastics&rdquo; name. The new tagline,&nbsp;&ldquo;The Composites Solution Partner,&rdquo;&nbsp;more accurately conveys CSP&rsquo;s commitment to delivering innovative, high-performance composite solutions to its customers.</p>\n\n<p>The redesigned logo features a sleek, modern aesthetic with thin lines and a forward-leaning stance &mdash; symbolizing motion, mobility&nbsp;and progress. Its lighter design reflects the advanced lightweight materials that define CSP&rsquo;s product portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This transition gave us an opportunity to return to a brand that is well recognized in the industry, while also giving it a fresh, contemporary update,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Kim Zitny, director of corporate communications. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to roll out our new brand identity across advertising, social media&nbsp;and upcoming industry events. A new website will also launch later this year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Now operating independently, CSP remains focused on building strong partnerships with leading OEMs and delivering solutions for the transportation industry. CSP will continue its North American operations at the following locations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ohio: Carey, Conneaut, North Baltimore, Van Wert</li>\n\t<li>North Carolina: Lenoir, Salisbury</li>\n\t<li>Louisiana: Sarepta</li>\n\t<li>Indiana: Grabill, Huntington</li>\n\t<li>Texas: Seguin</li>\n\t<li>Michigan: Auburn Hills (two&nbsp;locations), Manchester</li>\n\t<li>Mexico: Saltillo, Tijuana.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that CSP&rsquo;s operations are limited to North America. The European operations previously under Teijin Automotive Technologies are not part of this transition and remain separate.</p>"
