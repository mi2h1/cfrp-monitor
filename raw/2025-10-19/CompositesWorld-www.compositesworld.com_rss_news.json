The factory is purpose-built to serve the wind energy sector, expanding Exel&rsquo;s existing delivery capability in other regions. Following testing throughout 2024 and 2025, the site is now fully operational with dedicated lines for carbon fiber products used in turbine blades.</p>\n\n<p>Completed in 2024, the plant was developed by Exel Composites and long-standing partner Kineco Group (Goa, India), with its machinery and layout specifically tailored for high-volume production of carbon fiber components. The first full customer approvals have been achieved, and the volume shipments of carbon fiber flats have<strong> </strong>started, marking the start of sustained deliveries to major wind energy manufacturers in the region.</p>\n\n<p>These flats, used in turbine blades as structural reinforcements such as in spar caps, are designed to handle the rising mechanical loads as blade lengths increase. The demand for components like these has grown rapidly in recent years as India added a further 4.15 gigawatts&nbsp;to its wind capacity in 2024, bringing the total to 50 gigawatts.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Reaching volume production capacity in India marks a leap in our long-term plans to support the wind industry,&rdquo; explains&nbsp;Kari Loukola, executive vice president of industrial solutions at Exel Composites. &ldquo;By localizing our pultrusion capabilities in India, we can supply high-performance components close to the point of use, helping our customers meet their business goals.&rdquo; The milestone follows a &euro;10 million order from a South Asian manufacturer last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The facility dedicates most of its capacity to wind components, including flats, joiners&nbsp;and bolt fixtures, and with production now underway, KECI is positioned to strengthen India&rsquo;s wind supply chain and support the delivery of larger, more efficient turbines.</p>\n\n<p><em>For related content, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/kineco-exel-to-manufacture-pultruded-carbon-fiber-planks-for-vestas\">Kineco Exel to manufacture pultruded carbon fiber planks for Vestas</a>.&rdquo;</em></p>"

Source | Syensqo</p>\n</div>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">High-performance polymers company <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/solvay-composite-materials\" target=\"_blank\">Syensqo</a> (Brussels, Belgium) received four&nbsp;recognitions from the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/spe-society-of-plastics-engineers\" target=\"_blank\">Society of Plastics Engineers</a> (SPE) at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://speautomotive.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2025 SPE Automotive Awards</a>. The honors were awarded following a rigorous evaluation by a jury of 35 industry experts who assessed submissions for their sustainability impact and technological innovation. The awards ceremony took place in Bonn, Germany.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;These awards represent a powerful recognition of Syensqo&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and sustainable mobility,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Matthias Braem, Syensqo&rsquo;s vice president of transportation. &ldquo;By combining Syensqo&rsquo;s materials expertise with the innovation of our partners, we are enabling solutions that make vehicles lighter, safer&nbsp;and more sustainable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The first place award in &ldquo;Chassis &amp; Structural Components&rdquo; category was granted for a toothed belt pulley for rear axle steering, developed together with ZF Group&nbsp;and manufactured using Ryton BR111&nbsp;BL &mdash; a&nbsp;black-colored glass fiber and mineral-filled polyphenylene sulfide compound.</p>\n\n<p>According to Syensqo, this component exemplifies the&nbsp;potential of specialty polymers in critical automotive systems. It withstands demanding operating conditions up to 150&deg;C in the presence of oils, while retaining dimensional accuracy and wear resistance. Compared with traditional sintered metal solutions, it delivers&nbsp;45% weight reduction, enabling a 30% smaller carbon footprint and reducing noise, vibration&nbsp;and harshness for a smoother driving experience.</p>\n\n<p>Another distinction went to a miniaturized collimator mount produced by Jabil Optics, using&nbsp;Ryton PPS BR111 BL&nbsp;and molded by Ningbo Sunrise for Lucid Gravity electric vehicles (EVs), which earned third prize in the same category. The use of Syensqo&rsquo;s specialty polymer enabled a 79% reduction in material carbon footprint compared to conventional aluminum alternatives.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Syensqo&rsquo;s Amodel&nbsp;PPA resins family use fiber reinforcements, heat stabilizers, impact modifiers, flame retardants, minerals and other additives to achieve a broad range of performance, price and processing options.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two additional nominations highlighted Syensqo&rsquo;s contributions to next-gen electric mobility. The first recognizes a high-voltage connector for Bosch e-motors, molded by Furnel Inc. This innovation combines Syensqo&rsquo;s Amodel PPA with an optimized design that delivers high electrical performance, enhanced flame resistance, and a 50% reduction in production cycle time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The second nomination celebrates a power module developed with Semikron-Danfoss Elektronik GmbH, made from&nbsp;Amodel&nbsp;Bios HFFR R1-133, which according to Syensqo&rsquo;s website features a &ldquo;partially bio-sourced&nbsp;long-chain PPA made from non-food competing biomass and [is] produced using&nbsp;100% renewable electricity.&rdquo;&nbsp;With a surface tracking resistance of 900 volts&nbsp;and a relative thermal index of 140&deg;C, this solution enables miniaturization and long-term reliability. Its compatibility with laser welding simplifies assembly, while its sustainable formulation and transition to recycled aluminum reduce the component&rsquo;s carbon footprint by approximately 40%.</p>"
