The publication outlines how manufacturers can embed sustainability into design, production&nbsp;and end-of-life (EOL) management to reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance and reliability.</p>\n\n<p>The white paper examines the environmental impact of composites throughout their life cycle. It highlights the industry&rsquo;s reliance on virgin raw materials and the growing determination to address the recycling challenge posed by composites&rsquo; durability. Drawing on examples from industrial-scale recycling initiatives and Exel&rsquo;s internal programs, the paper argues that design choices and efficient production are just as important as EOL processes. It emphasizes the need for transparency, interoperability&nbsp;and shared responsibility across the value chain to close these gaps.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-Exel-whitepaper-physical-copy.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Exel Composites white paper physical copy.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2026-CW/1225-cw-news-Exel-whitepaper-physical-copy.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Authored by Exel&rsquo;s senior vice president of technology and sustainability, Kim Sj&ouml;dahl, the white paper brings together insight from research and operations teams across Europe and Asia. Sj&ouml;dahl is a longstanding contributor to the European Composites Industry Association (EuCIA) and its European Circular Composites Alliance (ECCA), which work to establish <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/the-ecca-welcomes-160-organizations-begins-composites-circularity-roadmap-development\" target=\"_blank\">unified sustainability standards</a> across the sector.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Circularity begins with design,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Sj&ouml;dahl. &ldquo;The choices made at the start of a product&rsquo;s life determine how easily it can be reused, repurposed&nbsp;or recycled later. Manufacturers must think beyond single products and consider how each decision affects the wider material ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The paper outlines Exel&rsquo;s own life cycle approach as an example of how industry ambition can translate into measurable change. Initiatives include a <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/exel-composites-fairmat-sign-carbon-fiber-scrap-repurpose-deal\" target=\"_blank\">partnership with Fairmat</a> to recycle carbon fiber waste through low-energy robotic cutting, and collaborations with Alta Performance Materials and Owens Corning to integrate bio-based and recycled raw materials into manufacturing. Exel&rsquo;s Finnish facilities now use exclusively renewably produced electricity, divert more than 99%&nbsp;of waste from landfill and reintroduce hundreds of tons of recovered material into production annually.</p>\n\n<p>Against this backdrop, the report addresses one of the industry&rsquo;s most persistent challenges:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/trends-fueling-the-composites-recycling-movement\" target=\"_blank\">how to achieve recycling at scale</a>. Cement co-processing remains the most commercially viable recycling route for composites, but more opportunities are developing all the time. Competing interests risk turning advocates for recycling methods like pyrolysis and solvolysis into rival camps, slowing collective progress toward circularity. Rather than setting these approaches against one another, Sj&ouml;dahl envisions a common direction in which established and emerging technologies evolve together.</p>\n\n<p>Sj&ouml;dahl concludes,&nbsp;&ldquo;Circularity will not be achieved through competition but through coordination. Every actor across the value chain has a role to play. By sharing data, aligning goals&nbsp;and combining expertise, the composites industry can move faster toward a sustainable future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>View the white paper <a href=\"https://ideas.exelcomposites.com/whitepaper-sustainability-in-the-composites-industry\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"

The work has continued across Gurit&rsquo;s epoxy formulated range, with alternatives now available for most of the affected Gurit products.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Gurit solutions have not affected cost or performance, a result which has been well received by customers, for whom it has been business-as-usual, with minimal impact on product qualification status.</p>\n\n<p>The following Gurit products are not classified as CMR and are available immediately:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Ampreg 32 (alternative to Ampreg 30) and Ampreg 33 (alternative to Ampreg 31) laminating systems</li>\n\t<li>Ampreg 32/33 Thixotropic Pregel</li>\n\t<li>Spabond 730, Spabond 575 (alternative to Spabond 570), Spabond 5 minute and BondPro 200 Series adhesives</li>\n\t<li>Ampro multipurpose system</li>\n\t<li>S-Fair 700 filling and fairing compound.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Gurit&rsquo;s response to the changes is aligned with the company&rsquo;s global chemical safety strategy. The team continually monitors the regulatory landscape for early warnings of possible reclassifications and diligently works to reduce the number of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs), high hazard and CMR substances used in formulations and at production sites. The situation remains dynamic with new reclassifications occurring every year, resulting in an ever-growing SVHC list. Chemical safety and product performance are always front-of-mind for the Gurit team. By proactively testing, researching and developing alternatives, they ensure that customers can continue to access safer and high performing epoxy products.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Protecting our colleagues, our customers&nbsp;and the end users of our products is a responsibility we take seriously, and we&rsquo;re committed to staying ahead of regulatory change,&rdquo; adds Amy Moram, chemical compliance manager and sustainable products lead, Gurit. &ldquo;By continually reformulating and improving our chemistry, we ensure the composite market can rely on materials that are not only high-performing but also free from chemicals of concern.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Supply chain communication of the EU&rsquo;s&nbsp;classifications began this year, with harmonized classification expected to become legally binding for some substances from 2026.</p>"

They enable&nbsp;controls to be built into 3D panels of any shape so users can find the right function by touch alone. This offers a safer option than touchscreens in vehicles as it allows drivers to keep their eyes on the road, and it is more slick and hygienic than buttons, as well as being cheaper to produce.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy&rsquo;s technology works with any standard plastic and or glass surface and can incorporate vibrations or voice feedback.&nbsp;It uses standard manufacturing processes which keeps costs down and is highly recyclable. It also works in the presence of liquids which make it suitable for marine cockpits or domestic hobs and washing machines.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Introducing smart surfaces to composite structures</h3>\n\n<p>Manufacturers are increasingly moving away from touchscreens in favor of physical controls, due to safety concerns in the car industry and complaints about malfunctions in appliances and smart devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But adding touch-interactive surfaces to composite structures can force uncomfortable compromises. The fundamental problem with capacitive touch sensing depends on predictable electromagnetic field behavior, and composites can inhibit this.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy has developed an optical waveguide approach to surface sensing that sidesteps this problem. Operating via frustrated total internal reflection at 950 nanometers, the technology is electrically indifferent &mdash; conductivity, permittivity and EMI environments simply don&rsquo;t participate in the sensing mechanism. It functions on the curved surfaces composites naturally produce, operates reliably with gloved hands and wet conditions typical of composite applications, and delivers 3D touch data including contact pressure and finger orientation.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy believes there could be an opportunity for collaboration to develop intelligent structures&nbsp;without sacrificing form or function, hitherto difficult with capacitive touch sensing.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The technology has already been successfully trialed by Hyundai and Grupo&nbsp;Antolin, which are now exploring ways to incorporate it into their vehicles. The fresh investment will now enable Uniphy to develop its own integrated chip in preparation for mass manufacturing and miniaturize its technology for use in mobile applications.</p>\n\n<p>Uniphy was founded by microelectronics experts David Lomas and David Dean in 2015. The company, which is based in Leeds with an R&amp;D&nbsp;center&nbsp;in Swindon, now employs 15 staff and expects to create five new jobs in the year ahead. The latest round brings the total it has raised to date to more than&nbsp;&pound;13 million.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As humans we spend much of our lives interacting with machines &mdash;&nbsp;on our mobiles, in our cars or our homes &mdash;&nbsp;but the limitations of current controls can make it a frustrating experience,&rdquo; says Jim Nicholas, CEO of Uniphy. &ldquo;Uniphy&rsquo;s technology offers designers the freedom to create new, more intuitive interfaces and transform the way we engage with machines.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund II (NPIFII) covers the entire North of England. Its purpose is to drive sustainable economic growth by supporting innovation and creating local opportunity for new and growing businesses.</p>"

And we have a 3D printer that can print commercial aerospace-grade composite structures. I think the breakthrough was combining those two things into one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wu used&nbsp;the continuous carbon fiber 3D printer to print bundles of fiber, with each fiber about the diameter of a human hair. As the fiber bundles are drawn by the printer onto a bed, they are compressed and exposed to ultraviolet light, which partially cures them.</p>\n\n<p>The energy-efficient liquid resin is molded with the printed carbon fiber design then frozen. When the 3D structure is needed, the resin is activated with a low-energy heat stimulus that sets in motion a chemical reaction to cure it into a curved 3D shape.</p>\n\n<p>This process, called &ldquo;frontal polymerization,&rdquo; eliminates the need for ovens or autoclaves large enough to cure a full-sized satellite dish. Much like a single match can set a sheet of paper or a house on fire, the thermal trigger is the same amount of energy for any size structure, making the process scalable for extra-large structures needed in space.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For me, the first challenge was to solve the inverse problem,&rdquo; Wu explains. &ldquo;You have a design for the 3D shape you want, but what is the 2D pattern to print that results in that shape? I had to write mathematical equations to describe the shapes to print the exact pattern. This study solved that problem.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wu sourced equations and wrote the code to program the printer to deposit the fiber bundles onto a bed to create five different 3D configurations: a spiral cylinder, a twist, cone, a saddle and a parabolic dish.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Together, they show the diversity of shapes we can make. But I think the one that&rsquo;s most interesting and applicable is the parabolic dish, which mimics the smooth, curved shape that&rsquo;s needed for deployable satellites,&rdquo; he says. Wu took inspiration&nbsp;from a Japanese art form called <em>kirigami</em> &mdash; similar to origami but includes cuts in addition to folds. &ldquo;I see research as very artistic. Sometimes, you get a creative idea and just pursue it. In this case, the parabolic shape begins in 2D with cuts like flower petals that all curve toward the same point. I had to figure out the angles where they overlap. A satellite dish made with just origami folds would need an infinite number of folds to make the smooth curvature required for satellite signals. In our case, rather than using folds, we achieve smooth curvature through controlled bending governed by the printed fiber bundles.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1125-cw-news-UofIllinois-2D-3D-shapes.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1125-cw-news-UofIllinois-2D-3D-shapes.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Left column: 3D representation of the intended shape. Middle column: Fiber bundle pattern determined by analytical solution or numerical methods. Right column: Manufactured with frontal polymerization of five shapes: (a) Archimedes spiral cylinder, (b) strip of increasing twist, (c) cone, (d) saddle and (e) parabolic dish.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Because the shape needs to morph, Wu&rsquo;s fiber infrastructure needed a very low fiber volume fraction.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Space structures need to be very stiff, and the more fiber volume, the stiffer the structure,&rdquo; he continues.&nbsp;&ldquo;But they need a lot of energy to morph and could break with large bending. To get a high-morphing degree, we need a low fiber volume ratio so it will be flexible enough to morph into a curved shape.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The study achieved both lower energy and higher stiffness compared to what&rsquo;s been done before. But Wu says&nbsp;the stiffness is still not adequate for space structures. &ldquo;We suggest using the activated 3D shapes as molds to manufacture high stiffness structures in space. You could manufacture the flat gel material with carbon fiber bundles on Earth, transport it into space and activate the shape through a thermal stimulus. But because it&rsquo;s not rigid enough, you can further use the 3D shape as a mold, adding high-stiffness plies, activate frontal polymerization again and then peel off the high-stiffness composite that is formed to the shape of the initial design. We show in our work that this process can be repeated numerous times without damage to the mold or deviation from the initial morphed shape.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wu adds that these same materials and processes could be used to supply needed structures to remote environments on Earth as well.</p>\n\n<p><em>This work is supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory.</em></p>"

With EPDs, manufacturers can clearly communicate the environmental performance of their products, supporting data-driven decision-making and greater confidence among specifiers, designers and end users.</p>\n\n<p>The PCR was developed under the guidance of a technical committee of industry experts and subjected to a public comment and review process to ensure transparency, credibility&nbsp;and alignment with stakeholder and market needs. NSF International functioned as PCR program operator for the project. Funding for the PCR development was provided by ACMA&rsquo;s Composites Growth Initiative Fund, recognizing the critical role EPDs play in accelerating market growth for composite infrastructure materials.</p>\n\n<p>With EPDs developed under this PCR, civil/structural engineers, architects, state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and other specifying agencies will be able to evaluate environmental impacts alongside cost and performance when selecting rebar materials for reinforced concrete projects. This enables a more holistic assessment of FRP rebar&rsquo;s benefits, including its durability, corrosion resistance&nbsp;and contribution to longer service life.</p>\n\n<p>The FRP Rebar PCR, NSF-1125-25 Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composite Products - Rebar or Dowel Bars, is now publicly available in the <a href=\"https://d2v-g604.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/W+113/d2v-g604/VWvq247GsgHKW30-SBS3TW0DhW33LWhB5Gg5vhN412x8T5kBVzW50kH_H6lZ3nWW1j2Lzx51bvfmW8rgF4q3k6LC4N2HxcJqdkhV9W93X4BZ8FBBbZW4LmHs95mT9j4W2twcNt56F4jwW4M06z43db_-wW2vSMsg1zcSgMW1vSTVK3t9C5SW6QsQcn21gfSlMWnQkqsKw7gW2bG44v82mZGkW5mQ1Jj4yK4Z6N6QFDW9FC7DFW7Q1dz299B02CW8n5w6K1S0MH0W6_G3Vs2XBdFWW4mbsZd8Pr7mLV-mssX6N3NPxW4Y16_F5cCLmdW29pM1j7hP-Z4W7y5JR88fjQtXVTL2vG4ZHl3lW5RcmKt8Bxh72F4vQflCb_b0W8B16HT414y3wW6ZBKNg6m--RtW5FdFGB6l9NXRW90x6Dx2YxjKGV-nPg_5Jb8R1W7ffclZ5wHRJwVNlPxD6hCrRZf2HWtYW04\" target=\"_blank\">ACMA Composites Sustainability Library</a> as well as on the <a href=\"https://d2v-g604.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/W+113/d2v-g604/VWvq247GsgHKW30-SBS3TW0DhW33LWhB5Gg5vhN412xbl3m2nnW7Y8-PT6lZ3ldW3LdSTG1_r_MSN7Cc3yvN9Mq_W9lY9PG77L0FRW2xsvQS27yCdvV71VZ58c-TqgW5h4tpM6h45h2W7SknRC6xKmvWW8dkKMF80P6v6W1SHxGz787-_wW4bBktD8Jg22tW8yvqtg735Hz7N5td3LxdPmh3W3-5nPG7Xcl_MW59cz5-4sTjsqVm7t8b7bNzHyW1n_8Wc295MGJW6gMhC8522NK-W7DR0TM47n50GN1tNZt0W0J_YW5-LJDD3tzT6JW4vPjc_6tB8GjW2dbkzx4Sz6XcW2BSDSH8gd76TW38fwZx8v5lpPN8qR-8dPLw7jW46XGr73RSl8bf2B63vs04\" target=\"_blank\">NSF International website</a>, serving as the foundation for EPD development across the industry.</p>\n\n<p><em>For related content read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/acma-announces-pcr-publication-for-platforms-stairways\">ACMA announces PCR publication for platforms, stairways</a>.&rdquo;</em></p>"
