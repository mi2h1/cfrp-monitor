It is not only fully recyclable but can reportedly be installed in 15 minutes, reducing installation time by 50% as well as the need for lifting equipment, heavy goods transportation and service roads. Its lightweight also significantly reduces the amount of concrete needed for the structure&rsquo;s foundations.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This award recognizes our innovative work as part of the <a href=\"https://cp.catapult.org.uk/opportunity/clean-futures-accelerator-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Catapult Clean Futures Accelerator</a>,&rdquo; says Composites Braiding general manager, Steve Barbour. &ldquo;Described by industry experts as &lsquo;game-changing,&rsquo;&nbsp;this is the kind of innovation that can transform infrastructure delivery.&rdquo; The Clean Futures Accelerator is a program within Catapult Connected Places, part of The Innovate UK Catapult Network.</p>\n\n<p>Reporter Lisa Baker explained in a <em><a href=\"https://businessinthenews.co.uk/2025/02/11/composite-braiding-to-showcase-low-carbon-rail-technology-at-clean-futures-demonstration-day/#:~:text=With%20the%20use%20of%20steel,Manufacturing%20Organisation%20headquarters%20in%20Dudley.\" target=\"_blank\">Business in the News</a></em> article that steel cantilevers across the U.K.&rsquo;s rail network number in the tens of thousands. Composite Braiding&rsquo;s technology has the potential to considerably reduce the carbon footprint of the sector &mdash; a critical step for the U.K. to reach its target of net-zero railways by 2050.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0725-cw-news-tpc-twin-track-cantilever-braid.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"braiding machine at Composite Braiding in UK\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0725-cw-news-tpc-twin-track-cantilever-braid.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With our manufacturing capabilities, we combine fibers like carbon, glass and basalt with thermoplastics to create advanced composites quickly and at scale,&rdquo; says Composite Braiding&rsquo;s technical director, Alastair Barnett. &ldquo;This&nbsp;fully automated process can reduce labor costs by 90%, industrial waste by 97% and uses 95% less energy that traditional composites manufacturing. We believe that our new lightweight cantilever design is the next step in sustainable rail infrastructure and, once scaled, can truly help to move the needle toward&nbsp;a low-carbon, cost-effective rail network for the future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/business/composite-braiding-marks-major-new-milestone-for-decarbonising-uk-rail-5022123\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Witton in the <em>Derbyshire Times</em></a>, Composite Braiding&rsquo;s lead development engineer, Guy Lawrence, explained the innovative design:</p>\n\n<p class=\"m-l-2\">&ldquo;We had one simple aim &mdash; to show that composite rail infrastructure is not just a viable alternative to steel, but brings substantial mechanical, economic and environmental benefits. Our main driver was mass reduction, which ultimately leads to lower installed costs per unit, improved worker safety and significantly reduced installation time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"m-l-2\">&ldquo;Our unique ability to easily adapt product designs means each unit can be tailored mechanically and aesthetically for its given application, while our in-house production methodology enables low-cost, high-volume production of high-performance composites that is repeatable, predictable and easily scalable. By using thermoplastic composites, we can manufacture rail infrastructure that is truly sustainable: low waste, low energy usage, recyclable and repairable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Composites Braiding notes that large structural components are ubiquitous in&nbsp;the rail industry, both in infrastructure and rolling stock. That&rsquo;s where its braiding equipment generates value, able to produce large recyclable components from carbon, glass and/or basalt fiber, combined with sustainable thermoplastics. It can produce tubes and beams of almost any shape that significantly reduce weight and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>\n\n<p>The company thanks Connected Places Catapult, BCIMO and Coventry University for their support through the Clean Futures Accelerator and its in-house Composite Braiding team for succeeding in this&nbsp;achievement.</p>"

AnalySwift says it is a powerful tool for modeling composite rotorcraft (helicopter, air mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles) and wind turbine rotor blades, as well as other slender composite structures, such as propellers, landing gear&nbsp;and high-aspect ratio wings.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are pleased that Florida International University has found VABS helpful in&nbsp;their design and analysis workflow as they improve longevity and functional capabilities of aerospace structures,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Allan Wood, president and CEO of&nbsp;AnalySwift. &ldquo;As a versatile, cross-sectional analysis tool, VABS delivers high-fidelity results early on to help computationally resolve engineering challenges, reduce trial and errors&nbsp;and arrive at the best solution more quickly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Hadi Ebrahimi Fakhari, a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering at the university explains their research project, which&nbsp;focuses on developing a constructal&nbsp;design approach to identify configurations for aerospace structures that maximize longevity, enhance safety&nbsp;and expand functional capabilities. &ldquo;I support this work through a combination of finite element analysis [FEA], theoretical analysis&nbsp;and experimental validation,&rdquo;&nbsp;Ebrahimi Fakhari&nbsp;explains. &ldquo;In the FSI&nbsp;Laboratory, we analyze the forces and boundary conditions generated by airflow and use them as inputs to study structural responses. Our goal is to improve designs by facilitating smooth stress distribution and preventing stress concentrations, with a primary focus<br />\nis on aerospace structures, particularly wings and antennas.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Professor Pezhman Mardanpour, director of the FSI laboratory, describes how his team&nbsp;incorporated VABS into their workflow. &ldquo;They first designed the cross-section and used VABS to obtain the stiffness matrix. Then, they used another tool to determine the trimmed shape and flutter speed. Finally, they performed stress recovery using VABS once again.&rdquo;</p>"

Source | SpaceX on Unsplash</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>The cross-industry collaborative project &ldquo;High Value Composite Applications &ndash; A Joint Market and Technology Study on Opportunities for Fiber-Reinforced Plastics in Space &amp; Defense Applications&rdquo; brings together international companies to explore and quantify the potential of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs) in space and defense, two dynamics markets with a rapidly growing demand for high-performance,&nbsp;lightweight, and modular components is accelerating rapidly in both sectors. This JPP&nbsp;aims to provide participants with a consolidated market and technology roadmap, combining deep technical insights with actionable strategic data.</p>\n\n<p>The project will be executed as a pre-competitive, cost-shared initiative moderated and conducted by AZL. This format enables&nbsp;companies from across the value chain to jointly define focus topics, benefit from AZL&rsquo;s expertise in market and technology analysis&nbsp;and contribute their own perspectives throughout the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project will begin with a Kick-off Meeting on July 15, 2025. All participating companies will have the opportunity to introduce their organizations, share their expectations&nbsp;and help define the specific scope of the study. Companies interested in participating are invited to request the detailed project description and schedule an individual consultation with AZL&rsquo;s industrial services team.</p>\n\n<h3>Fire safety testing for EV battery casings</h3>\n\n<p>In response to the growing importance of thermal management and fire protection in electromobility, the &ldquo;Thermal Runaway Testing for Battery Casings &ndash; Benchmarking Systems for High-Gradient Heating and Hot Particle Blasting&rdquo; initiative focuses on developing and implementing a realistic and reproducible fire testing environment for structural and functional materials used in electric vehicle (EV)&nbsp;battery housing systems.</p>\n\n<p>The project centers around the development and implementation of a new test bench that combines high-gradient flame exposure and controlled hot particle impact,&nbsp;mimicking the complex conditions of thermal runaway events in modern cell technologies such as LFP and NMC. This setup enables systematic benchmarking of materials under stress conditions that reflect actual applications in automotive, but also in other segments like aerospace, where efficient development of safe battery storage systems is essential. Participating companies will not only have access to the final benchmarking results but can also contribute material configurations for testing as part of the project.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-azl-jpp-visuals4.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"EV thermal runaway testing.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-azl-jpp-visuals4.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Real cell testing.

Detailed test documentation, including videos and thermal data, will be provided. The resulting matrix supports materials development, qualification&nbsp;and supplier evaluation, offering both strategic and technical value.</p>\n\n<p>Within a predecessor collaboration involving a consortium of 24 industry players (including automotive OEMs like Audi, BMW, Tier suppliers&nbsp;and material producers), AZL&rsquo;s team of experts developed an application relevant instrumented test method that enables testing of materials at different flame temperatures and simultaneously measuring the material strength under fire load.</p>\n\n<p>In the project, more than 50 different materials (metals, plastics, fiber-reinforced, coated, compact, sandwich) were tested and benchmarked regarding their specific performance (survival at tensile load and 800&deg;C, 100&deg;C and 1200&deg;C flame exposure; failure; areal weight; cost per area). This new project&nbsp;builds on these results, know-how and test infrastructure implemented. It enables participants to pool resources, validate their own solutions&nbsp;and gain insight into leading alternatives in the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project will officially kick off on July 15, 2025. At the initial meeting, partners will align on expectations, present their priorities&nbsp;and help refine the testing focus.&nbsp;Companies interested in joining are encouraged to request detailed project information or arrange an individual consultation meeting.</p>\n\n<h3>Thermoplastic pressure vessel production</h3>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thermoplastic Pressure Vessel Production &ndash; Benchmarking of Design-for-Manufacturing Strategies to Optimize Material Efficiency and Cost&rdquo; will rethink vessel design and production holistically &mdash;&nbsp;aligning thermoplastic material properties with optimized design&nbsp;and manufacturing strategies to unlock their full economic and technological potential.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-azl-jpp-visuals3.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Winding of a thermoplastic pressure tank. \" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-azl-jpp-visuals3.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Winding of a thermoplastic pressure tank.

Source |<em>&nbsp;</em>Joe DelNero, NREL</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Deconstructing epoxy resins with hot acetic acid has the potential to provide a scalable and affordable solution for recycling carbon fiber composites, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09067-y\" target=\"_blank\">new research</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy Bio-Optimized Technologies to keep Thermoplastics out of Landfills and the Environment (BOTTLE) multi-organization consortium.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon fiber composites&nbsp;are generally made with epoxy-amine resins. &ldquo;We have to do something intense to get the fibers out, but we also must be careful not to degrade the chemicals in the resin beyond what&rsquo;s necessary, as that would waste all the time, energy&nbsp;and raw materials that went into making them in the first place,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Stephen Dempsey, a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a>&nbsp;(NREL, Golden, Colo., U.S.) and one of the first authors of the study.</p>\n\n<p>These resins are often made of highly complex mixtures of molecules. Some of these compounds are common, and shared across many industries that use carbon fiber composites, but others are not. In addition, it is currently challenging to&nbsp;identify exactly what the resin chemistry is before recycling. A recycling method for carbon fiber composites&nbsp;must therefore be extremely robust and capable of handling diverse resin formulations.</p>\n\n<p>The BOTTLE team&rsquo;s solution ended up being surprisingly simple. Hot acetic acid, the same compound that is found in vinegar, can cleave all the key bonds within these resins. Former NREL postdoctoral researcher Ciaran Lahive (now at University of Manchester), and co-first author on this study, demonstrated this reaction during an intensive reaction screening effort for another project.</p>\n\n<p>The team learned something remarkable: Not only do the polymer networks in the resin solubilize rapidly, but the acetic acid also stabilizes their chemical components, enabling high yields of reusable chemical building blocks. Extensive optimization work from NREL interns Katie Stevenson (now at Columbia University) and Sydney Reiber (now at the University of Graz) led to a process effective on end-of-life (EOL) waste from a variety of industries.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, the researchers also determined there was no impact on the strength of the recycled carbon fibers (rCF), which is critical to ensuring they retain their value after being extracted from the composite. To demonstrate this, they took 80 grams of a scrap mountain bike frame made of composite material and deconstructed it. Using the carbon fibers they had just extracted, they then made new composites that exhibited more than twice the strength-to-weight ratio of steel.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is the cost of rCF predicted to be quite low compared to virgin fiber, with a price of just $1.50 per kilogram, but the energy consumption is also practically zero when factoring in the recovered epoxy building blocks. The process is not limited to carbon fiber composite&nbsp;only &mdash; glass fiber composites like those found in turbine blades, boat hulls or automobile bumpers and hoods could also be treated.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Long-term, this technology could be used to create value from challenging composite waste streams that are currently piling up in landfills,&rdquo; says BOTTLE CEO Gregg Beckham, the senior author of the study and a senior research fellow at NREL. &ldquo;Current technologies are not yet able to make a dent in that waste stream, but we think that this process could be useful for this application as well.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The paper, &ldquo;Acetolysis of epoxy-amine resins for carbon fiber-reinforced polymer recycling,&rdquo; appears in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The other coauthors from NREL are William Michener, Hannah Alt, Kelsey Ramirez, Erik Rognerud, Clarissa Lincoln, Ryan Clarke, Nicholas Rorrer&nbsp;and Katrina Knauer.</p>\n\n<p><em>Funded by the U.S. DOE&rsquo;s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office and Bioenergy Technologies Office, the work was performed as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bottle.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BOTTLE consortium</a>.

Source | Altair, DAC</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/altair-engineering\" target=\"_blank\">Altair</a>&nbsp;(Troy, Mich., U.S.), part of Siemens Digital Industries Software, is deepening its&nbsp;ongoing collaboration with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.daccampania.com\" target=\"_blank\">Campania Aerospace District</a> (DAC, Napoli, Italy) to accelerate digital transformation across Italy and Europe&rsquo;s aerospace sector. The partnership aims to empower small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups by providing access to cutting-edge technology, driving innovation and enhancing competitiveness throughout the European aerospace supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>DAC, established in 2012, constitutes an ecosystem of 300 stakeholders &mdash;&nbsp; including 32 large companies, 123 SMEs, 15 universities and research centers such as CIRA, CNR and ENEA&nbsp;and 170 partners &mdash; providing synergy&nbsp;between public and private sectors to&nbsp;tackle complex challenges. DAC focuses on advancing four core aerospace areas: commercial aviation, general aviation, space systems and vectors, and maintenance and transformation.</p>\n\n<p>Much of&nbsp;its research and activities have achieved this through the use of composite materials.&nbsp;Specifically, the TOP project (developing and applying innovative processes for manufacturing and assembling composite material aerospace structures), the TABASCO project (developing low-cost production technologies and processes for composite structures in advanced aircraft) and the REVAIA-2 Project (developing composite structures made of cellulose fibers and resins derived from natural materials).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For DAC, the collaboration with Altair Engineering represents a strategic initiative that reflects a specific vision for supply chain development: guiding SMEs and startups toward an advanced production model based on the systematic adoption of digital tools and integration with research,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Luigi Carrino, president of DAC. &ldquo;Thanks to this agreement, we offer our member companies not only facilitated access to high-level simulation and data analysis technologies, but also training programs and concrete opportunities for technological acceleration and growth, consistent with the level of large companies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>A key challenge for many OEMs&nbsp;is maintaining digital continuity across their supply chains. SMBs frequently lack the resources, expertise&nbsp;or financial capability to implement the same technologies used by larger partners &mdash; often resulting in lower efficiency, longer lead times&nbsp;and reduced product quality. The Altair-DAC initiative directly addresses this gap.</p>\n\n<p>Under the program, SMBs gain access to Altair&rsquo;s simulation, data analytics, and AI technologies at discounted rates, enabling them to digitize engineering processes, improve efficiency&nbsp;and innovate faster. Startups are offered low-cost entry in their first year, followed by participation in Altair&rsquo;s Aerospace Startup Acceleration Program from the second year and onward.&nbsp;Altair&rsquo;s technology can also further bolster&rsquo;s DAC&rsquo;s work in composites design &mdash; enabling structural&nbsp;optimization, ply level optimization and more.</p>"
