Characterizations by SEM and TEM\nmicroscopies, UV-Vis, FTIR and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and\ndynamic light scattering were carried out in order to associate the morphology\nand structure of these materials to their electrical conductivity, and to\nexplain how EDOT and DBSA concentrations, and also the presence of NP, affects\nthose properties. It was found that the NP play a significant role in the\npolymerization of EDOT, influencing the formation and arrangement of polymer\nchains, as well as their conjugation length, oxidation state, and resonant\nstructures. These effects are also dependent on the DBSA content. To describe\nthe conductivity of the composites, a two-phase model based on general\neffective media theory was introduced.

    "summary": "In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by\nincorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the\ndesired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending\nmodule with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The\nSMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new\nstrain-limiting layer.

The complex and polarization-sensitive\nreflectivity of samples with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) substrates.\nIn this paper, we propose a combined hardware and software solution to address\nthese two limitations.

    "summary": "It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to\nlinear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of\nrecently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to\nnonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied\nsystematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a\nseries of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates.\nOur data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by\n(usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is\nnot acceptable for a robust method.

      "value": "It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to\nlinear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of\nrecently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to\nnonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied\nsystematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a\nseries of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates.\nOur data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by\n(usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is\nnot acceptable for a robust method.

The resulting FF was extensively validated against experimental\nresults and density functional theory calculations. We applied the new combined\nTNT-HMX FF to predict and rank surface and interface energies, which indicate\nthat there is an energetic driver for coarsening of microstructural grains in\nTNT-HMX composites. Finally, we assess the impact of several microstructural\nenvironments on the dynamic melting of TNT crystal under ultrafast thermal\nloading. We find that both free surfaces and planar material interfaces are\neffective nucleation points for TNT melting. However, MD simulations show that\nTNT crystal is prone to superheating by at least 50 K on sub-nanosecond\ntimescales and that the degree of superheating is inversely correlated with\nsurface and interface energy. The modeling framework presented here will enable\nfuture studies on hot spot formation processes in accident scenarios that are\ngoverned by strong coupling between microstructural interfaces, material\nmechanics, momentum and energy transport, phase transitions, and chemistry.",

By delivering a modular solution with\nvalidated accuracy, this work aims to promote innovation and practical\napplication in precision tracking technology, facilitating broader adoption and\niterative improvements. This approach enhances the accessibility and\nversatility of high-precision tracking technology, supporting future progress\nin the field."

In our work, we solve this challenge\nby first training a forward surrogate model based on the macroscopic\nstress-strain data obtained via computational homogenization for a given\nmultiscale material. To this end, we use partially Input Convex Neural Networks\n(pICNNs) to obtain a polyconvex representation of the strain energy in terms of\nthe invariants of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. The network architecture\nand the strain energy function are modified to incorporate, by construction,\nphysics and mechanistic assumptions into the framework. While training the\nneural network, we find the type of anisotropy, if any, along with the\npreferred directions. Once the model is trained, we solve the inverse problem\nusing an evolution strategy to obtain the design parameters that give a desired\nmechanical response. We test the framework against synthetic macroscale and\nalso homogenized data. For cases where polyconvexity might be violated during\nthe homogenization process, we present viable alternate formulations. The\ntrained model is also integrated into a finite element framework to invert\ndesign parameters that result in a desired macroscopic response. We show that\nthe invariant-based model is able to solve the inverse problem for a\nstress-strain dataset with a different preferred direction than the one it was\ntrained on and is able to not only learn the polyconvex potentials of\nhyperelastic materials but also recover the correct parameters for the inverse\ndesign problem.",

The network architecture\nand the strain energy function are modified to incorporate, by construction,\nphysics and mechanistic assumptions into the framework. While training the\nneural network, we find the type of anisotropy, if any, along with the\npreferred directions. Once the model is trained, we solve the inverse problem\nusing an evolution strategy to obtain the design parameters that give a desired\nmechanical response. We test the framework against synthetic macroscale and\nalso homogenized data. For cases where polyconvexity might be violated during\nthe homogenization process, we present viable alternate formulations. The\ntrained model is also integrated into a finite element framework to invert\ndesign parameters that result in a desired macroscopic response. We show that\nthe invariant-based model is able to solve the inverse problem for a\nstress-strain dataset with a different preferred direction than the one it was\ntrained on and is able to not only learn the polyconvex potentials of\nhyperelastic materials but also recover the correct parameters for the inverse\ndesign problem."

    "summary": "The production of 225Ac using either a proton or electron accelerator\nrequires a target of 226Ra. Radium metal is difficult to work with and so a\nradium salt, such as radium carbonate, is preferred as a target material.\nNormally available as a powder, the average density of the powder is low and\nthe thermal conductivity is poor, thus limiting the beam power that can be\ndissipated in the target. This work proposes the creation of a solid mixture of\na radium salt powder with a metal matrix. Although aluminum powder has been\nused in similar applications, we suggest that indium powder is good choice for\nthe metal matrix in the case of radioactive radium salts. The target can be\nformed with low die pressure without any need for heating, thus simplifying the\nhot-cell equipment needed for target preparation. We describe how the solid\nmixture can be formed, measure its thermal conductivity and compare the value\nto model estimates. We calculate the yield of 225Ac under different scenarios.\nCalculations show that the radioactive isotopes of indium produced during the\nirradiation should not produce significant handling challenges\npost-irradiation. For the proposed target geometry and beam parameters, thermal\nmodelling indicates that the target temperature will be below the melting point\nof indium and the heat flux from the surfaces will be manageable. Thermal\nresistance at the target interfaces is shown to have a large effect on the\ntarget temperature. Using indium powder to form the mixture, occupying about 40\n% of the target volume, we find that the yield of 225Ac is 80 GBq (2 Ci) for a\n10-day irradiation with a 24 MeV, 3 kW proton beam and approximately the same\nfor three milkings of 225Ra after a 10-day irradiation with a 25 MeV, 20 kW\nelectron beam.",

Up to date, data respecting multiple climates and all anatomical\ndirections are sparse for hygro-responsive materials like Norway spruce.\nConsequently, simulation models of wood frequently over-simplify creep, e.g.,\nby proportionally scaling missing components or neglecting climatic influences.\nTo overcome such simplifications, an automated computer-controlled climatized\ncreep rack was developed, that experimentally assesses moisture-dependent\nviscoelasticity and mechanosorption in all anatomical directions. The device\nsimultaneously measures the creep strains of three dogbone tension samples,\nthree flat compression samples, and six Arcan shear samples via Digital Image\nCorrelation. This allows for ascertaining the complete orthotropic compliance\ntensors while accounting for loading direction asymmetries. This paper explains\nthe creep rack's structure and demonstrates its use by determining all nine\nindependent creep compliance components of Norway spruce at 65% relative\nhumidity. The data shows that loading asymmetry effects amount up to 16%.\nFurthermore, the found creep compliance tensor is not proportional to the\nelastic compliance tensor. By clustering the compliance components, we identify\nfour necessary components to represent the full orthotropy of the compliance\ntensor, obtainable from not less than two experiments.",

    "summary": "While multi-axis 3D printing can align continuous fibers along principal\nstresses in continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic (CFRTP) composites to\nenhance mechanical strength, existing methods have difficulty generating\ntoolpaths with high fiber coverage. This is mainly due to the orientation\nconsistency constraints imposed by vector-field-based methods and the turbulent\nstress fields around stress concentration regions. This paper addresses these\nchallenges by introducing a 2-RoSy representation for computing the direction\nfield, which is then converted into a periodic scalar field to generate partial\niso-curves for fiber toolpaths with nearly equal hatching distance. To improve\nfiber coverage in stress-concentrated regions, such as around holes, we extend\nthe quaternion-based method for curved slicing by incorporating winding\ncompatibility considerations. Our proposed method can achieve toolpaths\ncoverage between 87.5% and 90.6% by continuous fibers with 1.1mm width. Models\nfabricated using our toolpaths show up to 84.6% improvement in failure load and\n54.4% increase in stiffness when compared to the results obtained from\nmulti-axis 3D printing with sparser fibers.",

This paper addresses these\nchallenges by introducing a 2-RoSy representation for computing the direction\nfield, which is then converted into a periodic scalar field to generate partial\niso-curves for fiber toolpaths with nearly equal hatching distance. To improve\nfiber coverage in stress-concentrated regions, such as around holes, we extend\nthe quaternion-based method for curved slicing by incorporating winding\ncompatibility considerations. Our proposed method can achieve toolpaths\ncoverage between 87.5% and 90.6% by continuous fibers with 1.1mm width. Models\nfabricated using our toolpaths show up to 84.6% improvement in failure load and\n54.4% increase in stiffness when compared to the results obtained from\nmulti-axis 3D printing with sparser fibers."

    "summary": "Oxygen vacancies in nickelates are known to introduce a variety of emergent\nphenomena and are considered to significantly affect conductivity. Few studies\nhave examined real-space evidence for oxygen vacancies on the surface,\nparticularly using scanning probe microscopy. Understanding the surface\ncomposition, both structurally and chemically, is crucial for the application\nof nickelates, such as in electrochemical water splitting reactions as\ncatalysts. In this study, we investigate a 20 nm epitaxial LaNiO3-x(LNO) film\ngrown on SrTiO3 (STO) via pulsed laser deposition. We examine the surface of\nthis film using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and reveal a complex\nsurface morphology composed of densely packed crystalline nanometer-sized\ncircular features with radius ranging from 10 to 20 nm. Scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy revealed an electronic inhomogeneity, or phase separation, in\nnanoscale islands of semi-conductive nature embedded within a metallic matrix.\nThis change in the electronic density of the states was associated with\nincreased concentration of oxygen vacancies. Further evidence for significant\noxygen vacancies at the surface was inferred by examining scanning tunneling\ntip-induced surface degradation. The strong electric field between the tip and\nsample likely facilitates oxygen removal in a vacuum environment, increasing\nthe formation of vacancies, which can lead to the breakdown of the crystal\nstructure. This provides insight into the possible origin of the chemical\nsurface transformation during the electrochemical water splitting reaction of\nthis nickelate.",
