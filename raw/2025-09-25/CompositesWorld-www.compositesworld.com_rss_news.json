Source (All Images) | MSP&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Global industrial group&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.leonardo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Leonardo</a> (Rome, Italy)&nbsp;has experienced a&nbsp;leap in its production of complex carbon fiber&nbsp;tiltrotor blades for one of its&nbsp;helicopter programs after implementation of&nbsp;advanced CNC metrology solutions from <a href=\"https://mspltd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Metrology Software Products</a>&nbsp;(MSP, Northumberland, U.K.)&nbsp;cut production time from 20 weeks to 3 days, an increase in productivity of more than&nbsp;4,500%.</p>\n\n<p>Leonardo has also seen its part alignment process reduced from days to 5 minutes, estimated scrap rate reduced from 95% to 0% and reliance on using fixtures for part alignment processes eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>Faced with the challenge of producing large, twisted composite blades that were deemed &ldquo;impossible to manufacture&rdquo;&nbsp;by simulation software due to varying levels of distortion and a thin tip making them hard to fixture, Leonardo turned to MSP&rsquo;s PerfectPart suite of metrology products.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;To align our parts, we would normally probe and measure parts using CAD, but as the composite blades are often all different and never conform to this data, we had to find another way,&rdquo; explains David Madigan, Leonardo tooling design engineer.</p>\n\n<p>Originally, Leonardo considered tackling the problem itself&nbsp;using traditional manufacturing methods, but this was predicted to create a 18-20 week lead time and&nbsp;was therefore&nbsp;deemed an unsuitable option. A feasible solution was metrology-package MSP PerfectPart. According to MSP, its&nbsp;NC-Checker and NC-PartLocator product modules give manufacturers error-free and right-first-time part production.</p>\n\n<p>NC-Checker was introduced as a standard operating procedure at Leonardo for its ability to assess the geometric performance of a CNC machine tool to check that it is capable of machining parts to tolerance. &ldquo;The tiltrotor blades are low volume and high value, so you don&rsquo;t want to risk scrapping any,&rdquo; says Madigan.&nbsp;&ldquo;NC-Checker allows us to monitor the machine tool in a simple way and gives us the confidence that no error on the machine will negatively impact the parts. Before we machine a blade, it is a stipulation that the software is run. Then, if something does go wrong, the first question is &lsquo;Well, did you run NC-Checker?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>NC-PartLocator was introduced to solve Leonardo&rsquo;s main challenge of accurately aligning the blades despite the unknown amounts of distortion. Unlike traditional part alignment methods, NC-PartLocator uses five-axis probing to measure a part on the machine and generate an accurate best fit alignment in six degrees of freedom.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-msp-leonardo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"MSP and Leonardo personnel.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0925-cw-news-msp-leonardo.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>MSP&rsquo;s James Dent (left) pictured with Leonardo tooling design engineer David Madigan (right) and CAD CAM engineer Keith Upton-Pittaway (middle).</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Most importantly in Leonardo&rsquo;s case, the software compensates for any discrepancy between the physical part location and the nominal machining program to show where the part &ldquo;really is&rdquo;&nbsp;on the machine. The updated alignment is automatically uploaded to the controller and any misalignment errors are automatically removed.</p>\n\n<p>Madigan admits&nbsp;the product shocked him.&nbsp;&ldquo;NC-PartLocator&rsquo;s alignment results can be quite surprising. The software often shows that the blade should be somewhere else entirely, even when it doesn&rsquo;t look any different on the surface.&rdquo; It has also aided his fixturing routine.&nbsp;&ldquo;I designed the fixtures based on the fact that you move the machine to the part instead of moving the part. All I needed to do was hold the part in position so it could be probed. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the blades were all variable and the position wasn&rsquo;t correct, as I knew NC-PartLocator would compensate for that. It&rsquo;s night and day compared to traditional methods.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And the results certainly show this difference. Using MSP as part of its processes, Leonardo has cut its estimated 20-week production time and 95% scrap rate to a stable 3-day production time with a potential for 0% scrap rate.</p>"

Using a modified data system from Bolder Flight Systems (Minneapolis, Minn., U.S.), the mission focused on proving that the team could build and operate a payload ready to integrate with a commercial spaceplane. Just as importantly, it served as a training mission &mdash; giving students hands-on experience and laying the groundwork for future Cal Poly launches from the upcoming Paso Robles, California Spaceport.</p>\n\n<p><em>Aurora</em>&rsquo;s horizontal launch architecture &mdash; taking off and landing like a conventional aircraft &mdash; offers benefits for academic institutions include rapid, reusable operations; reduced infrastructure costs; and expanded university access through commercial partnership.</p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"></div>\n\n<p>This mission builds on Dawn&rsquo;s recently announced partnership with the State of Oklahoma and the Department of Aerospace and Aeronautics (formerly Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority), to bring the <em>Aurora</em> spaceplane to the Oklahoma Air &amp; Space Port in Burns Flat &mdash; operations set to begin with first flights in 2027. This collaboration underscores a leap forward in scaling reusable suborbital spaceflight across the U.S.&nbsp;with operations at the Oklahoma Air &amp; Space Port set to extend <em>Aurora</em>&rsquo;s flight profile to 100 kilometers. By teaming with Cal Poly, Dawn says it is demonstrating how academic institutions can help lead this transformation while highlighting the opportunity for U.S. research units to leverage Oklahoma&rsquo;s forward‑looking spaceport as a national hub for innovation and direct access to space.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>Aurora</em> is the perfect tool for students to not only learn the theories of aerospace, but also design, build, qualify&nbsp;and operate in the real world,&rdquo; says James Powell, spaceplane&nbsp;chief engineer and co-founder. &ldquo;Because we recover the payload, customers gain deeper insight into performance and can more easily modify and upgrade for future flights.&rdquo;</p>"
