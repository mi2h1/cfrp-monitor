Specifically, the company is&nbsp;optimizing the processing and production of its&nbsp;phthalonitrile material systems to ensure that they continue to deliver on their potential to reduce the cost and time needed to produce hypersonics-ready&nbsp;carbon/carbon (C/C) composite parts by around 70%. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Cambium uses an&nbsp;AI-driven material discovery and development platform to rapidly and cost-effectively produce hypersonic-ready products through a domestic supply chain. Its&nbsp;phthalonitrile material systems include resins, prepreg and film adhesive that are capable of withstanding extreme environments in a range of applications from aerospace to hypersonics.</p>\n\n<p>Cambium&rsquo;s resins, for example, feature&nbsp;high service temperatures and thermal stability, reportedly outperforming traditional matrices; typical glass transition temperatures of the company&rsquo;s phthalonitrile matrices exceed 400&deg;C (750&deg;F). In addition, phthalonitrile products&nbsp;offer a higher-performing alternative to traditional polyimides. Cambium&rsquo;s phthalonitrile resins, prepregs&nbsp;and adhesives are room temperature stable, eliminating the need for cold storage of traditional composite materials.</p>\n\n<p>Cambium is working with a sense of urgency to optimize these systems in its contract with the Navy&rsquo;s Office of Naval Research (ONR), to create a secure domestic supply for hypersonics&nbsp;by significantly reducing lead times and cost roadblocks. Importantly, Cambium says its&nbsp;phthalonitrile-based high-temperature composite materials address key adoption issues in processing and production that were thought to be insurmountable, including developing C/C composite parts that are&nbsp;capable of surviving and performing in the extreme conditions that structures encounter at hypersonic speeds up to Mach 20.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. must establish a secure, scalable supply chain for advanced materials to support hypersonic systems at speed and scale,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Simon Waddington, Cambium&rsquo;s co-founder and CEO. &ldquo;Cambium is tackling this challenge head-on, developing next-generation thermal protection systems that are not only high-performing but also cost-effective and domestically manufactured. This Navy contract is another step forward in our mission to deliver materials solutions that strengthen national security and technological leadership.&rdquo;</p>"

These are attached to a high-strength steel chassis frame. &ldquo;We focused a lot on making sure we got the right material in the right place,&rdquo; he adds, noting the first essential was safety &mdash; Slate is an <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-2024-crash-test-vehicles-5-star-safety-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">NCAP five-star rated vehicle</a> &mdash; &nbsp;followed by reliability and durability, where he cites composites as a key enabler.</p>\n\n<p>Owners can personalize their Slate truck with more than&nbsp;100 accessories, available individually or bundled, at the time of purchase or as their needs change. These include bumper and fender styles, interior trim, roof racks and more. The flat-pack accessory SUV Kit, for example, turns the truck into a five-seat SUV, with a roll cage, airbags and rear seat. Owners can choose to install these extras themselves or have a partner auto shop help. Three levels of vehicle wrapping are also available for a customized exterior via vinyl wraps that is affordable while enabling inventive and easily updated looks.</p>\n\n<div></div>\n\n<p>Additional specifications include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>52.7-kilowatt-hour&nbsp;battery pack</li>\n\t<li>150-kilowatt&nbsp;rear-wheel drive</li>\n\t<li>Targeted range of 150 miles; optional accessory 84.3-kilowatt-hour&nbsp;battery pack targets 240 miles</li>\n\t<li>NACS port charge on a household outlet overnight or fast-charge to 80% at 120 kilowatts&nbsp;in under 30 minutes</li>\n\t<li>Active emergency braking, forward collision warning, up to eight airbags.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As reported by <em><a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a64654479/slate-ev-pickup-factory-location/\" target=\"_blank\">Car and Driver</a></em>, Slate is backed by Jeff Bezos and plans to manufacture its trucks at a repurposed 1.4-million-square-foot facility in Warsaw, Indiana. The company is currently retooling the factory, targeting delivery of its first EVs in 2026. It says it will keep costs low via direct-to-consumer sales and a nationwide service network.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicle cost is estimated at $27,500 but drops below $20,000 with federal EV tax credits. Customers can order their truck online, take delivery near their home, and find service locations in their neighborhood. Refundable $50 vehicle reservations are being accepted now.</p>"

The milestone is another step in the program as NASA prepares to launch a crew of&nbsp;four astronauts to further the agency's mission in establishing a human presence on the moon for exploration and scientific discovery. It will also help build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>What is Orion?</h3>\n\n<p><em>Orion</em> is a human-rated, deep space spacecraft. Launching atop NASA&rsquo;s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, <em>Orion</em> will carry the crew to lunar orbit and safely return them to Earth on Artemis missions. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor to NASA built the crew module, crew module adaptor and launch abort system.</p>\n\n<p>As reported in 2022 for <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/nasas-artemis-i-mega-rocket-launches-orion-to-moon\" target=\"_blank\">Artemis I&rsquo;s uncrewed <em>Orion</em> launch</a>, the spacecraft features many composites innovations, including a European Service Module (ESM), which has a primary structure&nbsp;making high use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/airbus-delivers-second-composites-intensive-european-service-module-for-nasas-orion-spacecraft\" target=\"_blank\">carbon fiber composites</a>, a composite&nbsp;large connector (<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/beyond-gravity-delivers-space-technology-composites-expertise-for-artemis-missions\" target=\"_blank\">universal stage adapter</a>) that links the launch vehicle and the service module, and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/nasa-orders-three-additional-orion-spacecraft-from-lockheed-martin\" target=\"_blank\">composite heat shield design</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-nasa-orion-breakdown.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-nasa-orion-breakdown.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Components of the <em>Orion</em> spacecraft.

Artemis II will put <em>Orion</em> through its final tests in deep space with a crew on board and will include learnings and significant enhancements gleaned from the Artemis I mission.</p>\n\n<p>To support the health and safety of the crew,&nbsp;new systems&nbsp;have been added, which include life support &mdash;&nbsp;air, water, thermal control, waste management &mdash;&nbsp;displays and controls, audio communications, an exercise machine and a fully functional launch abort system. Additionally, the vehicle is outfitted with a subset of docking sensors and an experimental laser communication system, enabling high data-rate communications and paving the way for future missions.</p>\n\n<p>With the completion of <em>Orion</em>, the EGS team will perform final preparations on the spacecraft, readying it for launch. <em>Orion</em>&nbsp;will soon be moved from the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center to various processing facilities. This is where EGS will load propellants and other consumables, such as water and oxygen, and install the launch abort system and its protective fairings. Upon completion, it will then be transported to the Vehicle Assembly Building, lifted onto the SLS&nbsp;rocket and undergo final preparations for launch.</p>\n\n<p>Scheduled to launch in early 2026, Artemis II and the<em> Orion</em> spacecraft will host NASA&nbsp;astronauts&nbsp;Reid Wiseman,&nbsp;Victor Glover,&nbsp;Christina Koch&nbsp;and Canadian astronaut&nbsp;Jeremy Hansen. Their 10-day journey will include flying 4,600 miles beyond the Moon and back to Earth.</p>\n\n<p>During the mission, the crew will evaluate the spacecraft's performance, test its navigation and communication systems, and conduct a series of scientific experiments. They will perform a rendezvous operation with the SLS upper stage, practicing docking activities needed for future missions including Artemis III &mdash;&nbsp;which will mark the first human lunar landing since Apollo 17 in 1972.</p>\n\n<p>With work on <em>Orion</em> for Artemis II completed, Lockheed Martin continues to develop and assemble <em>Orion</em> spacecraft for future Artemis missions. Artemis III and IV vehicles are in the Operations and Checkout Building, while the pressure vessel is being welded at NASA&rsquo;s Michoud Facility in&nbsp;New Orleans. Lockheed Martin is on&nbsp;contract&nbsp;to develop <em>Orion</em> spacecraft up to Artemis VIII and has decreased cost with each vehicle.</p>"

This &ldquo;resin pyrolysis&rdquo; enables HRC to efficiently separate the resin and carbon fibers rapidly without solid or liquid waste. This process is said to retain more than&nbsp;95% of the original mechanical properties of virgin carbon fiber, enabling demanding structural and functional applications.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to preserving performance, the technology significantly reduces the environmental impact of composite production, HRC reports. While manufacturing virgin carbon fiber emits&nbsp;about 19.849&nbsp;kilograms&nbsp;of CO<sub>₂</sub>e per kilogram, for example, the rCF produced through HRC&rsquo;s proprietary microwave pyrolysis process emits just 0.93 kilogram of CO<sub>₂</sub>e per kilogram.</p>\n\n<p>HRC&rsquo;s technology&nbsp;helps to reduce material expenses for automakers, minimizes energy use with no chemical pollution and supports scalability with commercial applications in interior and air curtain automotive components.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-hrc-closedloop-process.png\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0525-cw-news-hrc-closedloop-process.png;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>HRC's closed-loop system for composite applications.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this closed-loop process &mdash; a&nbsp;scalable business model for sustainable manufacturing&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;can&nbsp;meet rigorous automotive standards while helping manufacturers move toward their carbon neutrality goals, HRC says.</p>\n\n<p>However, the company&rsquo;s&nbsp;vision extends beyond. Its collaboration with the Airbus Lifecycle Services Centre (ALSC) launched China&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/airbus-officially-begins-operations-at-aircraft-lifecycle-center\" target=\"_blank\">first aircraft dismantling and recycling program</a>, converting decommissioned aerospace composites into high-value, low-carbon recycled carbon fiber (rCF) products. Similarly, HRC&rsquo;s partnership with HMC,&nbsp;Airbus&rsquo; joint venture in Harbin, will implement&nbsp;100% carbon fiber recovery, aiming to establish new benchmarks for industrial waste repurposing. HRC believes that these collaborations demonstrate how its ecosystem creates value chains that transcend traditional industry silos, proving that sustainability and profitability can be mutually reinforcing.</p>"

Accelerated development of these composites will support&nbsp;a blended wing body (BWB) aircraft design.</p>\n\n<p>According to the FAA, the FAST program is intended to &ldquo;demonstrate innovative composite manufacturing technologies capable of supporting advanced non-cylindrical pressure vessel designs at unprecedented production rates.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>JetZero is developing the Z4, an all-wing design commercial airplane. It is expected to produce&nbsp;greater lift and reduces drag, resulting in up to 50% better fuel efficiency than comparably sized tube-and-wing (T&amp;W) aircraft. The body of the all-wing is also wider and shorter than T&amp;W&nbsp;airplanes, with four interior cabins abreast, each with their own aisle and dedicated overhead bin space.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hexcel has been a key partner in our effort to develop and field an aircraft that will significantly reduce fuel consumption and associated emissions,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Kevin Brauning, head of structures, JetZero. &ldquo;Throughout our collaboration, Hexcel has continuously demonstrated its&nbsp;technical expertise of flexible composite material solutions, and a commitment to sustainable aviation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Hexcel&rsquo;s comprehensive carbon fiber and resin infusion technology portfolio and technological leadership in advanced aerospace materials led to the company&rsquo;s selection as the provider of composite materials for the structural demonstration of the all-wing design airplane, according to Brauning.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The R&amp;D already underway will allow us to evaluate various advanced composite materials and manufacturing technologies to optimize aircraft design and performance,&rdquo; adds&nbsp;Brauning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For related content, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/jetzero-announces-collins-aerospace-nacelles-new-campus-and-use-of-fiber-optic-sensors\" target=\"_blank\">JetZero announces Collins Aerospace nacelles, new campus and use of fiber optic sensors</a>.&rdquo;</p>"
