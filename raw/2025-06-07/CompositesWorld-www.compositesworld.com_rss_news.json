Source (All Images) | Engel</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/engel-austria\" target=\"_blank\">Engel</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;(Schwertberg, Austria)&nbsp;tie-bar-less Victory 180 injection molding technology and partner expertise&nbsp;supports new production possibilities for fiber-reinforced bicycle parts with fully integrated automation. A handlebar, recently manufactured for customer Canyon&nbsp;Bicycles GmbH (Koblenz, Germany) further highlights this high-performance, lightweight production capability.</p>\n\n<p>The Victory 180 combines a process for&nbsp;manufacturing hollow components via Engel fluidmelt technology and the simultaneous integration of glass fiber reinforcement. In the fluidmelt&nbsp;process, the molten core of a&nbsp;component is displaced during the cycle &mdash;&nbsp;either into an overflow cavity or back into the plasticizing unit &mdash;&nbsp;using water or nitrogen. This creates a hollow section within the part. The geometry of the component further enables the production of lightweight structures that still exhibit high bending and torsional stiffness. Once the cooling phase is complete, the component &mdash; in this case a hollow handlebar&nbsp;&mdash; is removed from the mold with an&nbsp;articulated robot.</p>\n\n<p>The handlebars are glass fiber-reinforced&nbsp;PA6. In addition, they&nbsp;are reinforced with four unidirectional carbon fiber&nbsp;tapes, which are bonded during the injection molding process. This combination enables high rigidity and structural stability, despite low wall thicknesses and a hollow cross-section.</p>\n\n<p>According to Engel, what was previously a labor- and energy-intensive process for Canyon Bicycles can now be completed in just 1&nbsp;minute as part of a mass production process. The fully automated production process enables immediate&nbsp;usability without the need for postprocessing, while&nbsp;reducing the CO<sub>₂</sub> footprint through targeted material use and full recyclability. The result is a component that delivers maximum functionality and matches the performance of aluminum.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0625-cw-news-Engel-Canyon-handlebar.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0625-cw-news-Engel-Canyon-handlebar.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0625-cw-news-Engel-Canyon-handlebar-sideview.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0625-cw-news-Engel-Canyon-handlebar-sideview.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>The Engel fluidmelt process enables the production of hollow components with high design freedom. Shown here is a cross-section of the bicycle handlebar/cockpit showing space for cable integration (bottom).<em> </em>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This combination of technologies reduces weight while offering high stability, geometric design freedom and the ability to integrate features such as cable routing or display mounts directly into a single production process,&rdquo; says Paul Zwicklhuber, technology manager for lightweighting solutions at Engel. &ldquo;That significantly lowers production costs and the carbon footprint, making manufacturing in Europe economically attractive again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The tie-bar-less design of the Engel Victory series offers an expanded mold space to enable&nbsp;the use of large and complex components or molds, all while maintaining a compact machine footprint. This makes it ideal for demanding geometries such as Canyon&rsquo;s bicycle handlebar. The machine&rsquo;s&nbsp;wide-platen variant features enlarged mounting platens, providing an additional 100 millimeters in width compared to standard models. As long as no higher clamping force is required, this design eliminates the need to invest in a larger machine, Engel says.</p>\n\n<p>For this project, Canyon Bicycles played a central role in the development of the new handlebar. The company contributed its expertise to the conceptual and functional design, ensuring that the component meets the exacting demands of cyclists who demand the quality components. Artefakt Design (Darmstadt, Germany)&nbsp;was responsible for&nbsp;the aesthetic design of the handlebar, developing a concept that is not only functional but also visually appealing, ensuring it integrates seamlessly into the modern appearance of Canyon bicycles. Domo Chemicals (Ghent, Belgium) supplied the injection molding compound and the necessary tapes for production, and Plastic Innovation GmbH (Ottensheim, Austria) was responsible for the mechanical component design, as well as the process and structural simulation. Finally, Simoldes&nbsp;(Oliveira de Azem&eacute;is, Portugal) was the&nbsp;contributed its extensive expertise in mold manufacturing and component production to ensure the high quality and reproducibility of the handlebar manufacturing process.</p>"

The customer approached Plastics Unlimited for a solution, resulting in replacing the original gelcoated fiberglass with a co-extruded ABS with acrylic cap to maintain vibrant appearances and performance&nbsp;even under harsh environmental conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to Plastics Unlimited, the new hood uses a process that bonds two materials into a&nbsp;single, high-performance structure. The outer layer is a 0.350-inch-thick, color-matched, co-extruded ABS with an acrylic cap, providing a Class A finish. This passes stringent accelerated weathering and corrosion tests, ensuring the orange color stays bright and fade-resistant. The structural backing, however,&nbsp;is still&nbsp;fiberglass, to ensure the delivery of high strength and to endure&nbsp;extreme temperatures &mdash; ideal for engine enclosures. Combined, the plastics and composites material systems offers durability, impact resistance and weight savings.</p>\n\n<p>The production part uses&nbsp;tooling consisting of a single-cavity, temperature-controlled aluminum mold, optimized for consistent quality and cycle time.</p>\n\n<p>Plastics Unlimited notes that no&nbsp;attachment points are visible from the Class A side, preserving a clean, professional appearance. Mounting brackets and screens are adhered to the B-side using structural adhesive. Moreover, assembly fixtures were designed and manufactured in-house to ensure tight customer tolerance requirements were met.</p>"

According to <a href=\"https://amtil.com.au/zero-emission-electric-hydrogen-flight/#:~:text=AMSL%20Aero%20uses%20many%20of,Lawrence%20Hargrave%2C%20was%20tested%20thoroughly.\" target=\"_blank\">a February 2025&nbsp;article</a> by AMTIL&rsquo;s <em>Australian Manufacturing Technology</em> (<em>AMT</em>) magazine, AMSL Aero&rsquo;s decision to go the hybrid route supports reduced operating costs, zero emissions and to enable long range (~1,000 kilometers). The eVTOL aircraft will be used for essential services in Australia such as medical, transfers, passenger and freight services.</p>\n\n<p>So far AMSL Aero has seen positive results based on tests at one of Australia&rsquo;s busiest airports. Results reveal that since mid-2024, AMSL Aero has used more than 200 kilograms of hydrogen. That is enough to fill an Olympic swimming pool at atmospheric pressure and successfully power its 100-kilowatt fuel cell test bench.</p>\n\n<p>The test bench works as a fully functional mock-up of the hydrogen powertrain for <em>Vertiia</em>, which reportedly&nbsp;made Australian aviation history in late 2024 by making its first free flights. AMSL Aero has won orders for <em>Vertiias</em> from general aviation operators including Bankstown Airport-based Aviation Logistics.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Make strides in eVTOL tech with composites innovation</h3>\n\n<p><em>AMT</em>&rsquo;s interview with AMSL Aero co-founder, chief engineer and <em>Vertiia</em> inventor Andrew Moore also delves into the aircraft&rsquo;s local design, manufacture and how fiber-reinforced composite materials are playing a vital role.</p>\n\n<p><em>Vertiia</em>&rsquo;s&nbsp;carbon fiber composite components are manufactured by various local Australian companies, including&nbsp;Innovation Composites, CST Composites and Quickstep Holdings, and are being used in &ldquo;unique areas,&rdquo; according to Moore which &ldquo;allows them to do things not viable for other design concepts.&rdquo; This has included selecting unique manufacturing methods.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The engineers at AMSL Aero propose a combination of conventional aerospace materials, such as carbon fiber&nbsp;composites, but using them in a slightly unconventional way. Some methods adopted along the way include infusion methods for certain parts,&rdquo; Moore tells <em>AMT</em>.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have used film winding for structural components and other more traditional aerospace manufacturing methods, like pre-impregnated composites under a vacuum.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Read the complete interview <a href=\"https://amtil.com.au/zero-emission-electric-hydrogen-flight/#:~:text=AMSL%20Aero%20uses%20many%20of,Lawrence%20Hargrave%2C%20was%20tested%20thoroughly.\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In just one year, our engineering team has successfully demonstrated the practical applications of hydrogen in aviation,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Chris Smallhorn, chairman of AMSL Aero. &ldquo;Our collaboration with Bankstown Airport is instrumental in our ongoing mission to offer longer-distance flights that cut both the cost and carbon footprint of travel across Australia and elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Simon Coburn, hydrogen lead at AMSL Aero, says&nbsp;the 200 kilograms&nbsp;of hydrogen used was sufficient to export 30 kilowatts&nbsp;of electricity into the airport grid for three working weeks and slash the airport&rsquo;s power bill by about 1.8 megawatt-hours&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>AMSL Aero has also deployed the test bench to Wellington Aerodrome in rural NSW for recharging <em>Vertiia</em> between test flights.</p>"
