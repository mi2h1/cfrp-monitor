Other investors included SFC Capital, DeepTech Labs, the U.S. venture fund Plug and Play and angel investors.</p>\n\n<p>Funding will enable HTMS to open a new production facility in Wiltshire and an office in Leamington Spa to continue its materials R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p>HTMS specializes in CMC materials. While lightweight and capable of withstanding extreme environments &mdash;&nbsp;CMC are widely used in the aerospace and space industries&nbsp;&mdash; their large cost of&nbsp;production means their use has been limited. The company was founded by&nbsp;Di Salvo and Grainger in 2021, who&nbsp;with&nbsp;more than 20 years of combined experience in the composites industry, found a method to significantly reduce&nbsp;energy, time and cost involved in producing CMC. HTMS&rsquo; aim is to bring CMC materials to a wider audience and create the U.K.&rsquo;s first&nbsp;domestic supply chain.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Richard and I saw the potential of advanced thermal composites but were frustrated with the high cost and lack of a U.K. supply chain,&rdquo; says Di Salvo, HTMS CEO and co-founder. &ldquo;This is a moment for British manufacturing. We are excited to scale up manufacturing of our products and look forward to growing our business and championing British innovation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The company is already working with automotive and battery manufacturers, as well as Cranfield University and other research institutes. As its CMC materials can withstand temperatures of up to 1400&deg;C, the company is currently focusing on their use in exhaust parts, brake shims and electric vehicle battery casings &mdash;&nbsp;three key thermal challenges facing the automotive industry.</p>\n\n<p>HTMS, which has a team of eight, is currently registered in Stratford-upon-Avon and has a laboratory in Bristol. Following its move to new and larger premises, it expects to create 40 new jobs over the next 4 years.</p>\n\n<p><em>For related content, read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ceramic-matrix-composites-faster-cheaper-higher-temperature\">Ceramic matrix composites: Faster, cheaper, higher temperature</a>.&rdquo;</em></p>"

More than 43,000 satellites are expected to be launched by 2035 &mdash; an average of 12 satellites and 8 tons of payload every day. This surge is set to drive a $665 billion market in manufacturing and launch services, fueled by mega-constellations, defense demand and rapid innovation in launch technology.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing a rapid expansion in satellite activity and a shift in how space is used,&rdquo; says Gabriel Deville, manager at Novaspace. &ldquo;Satellites are no longer just custom-built assets, they&rsquo;re evolving into interconnected nodes within decentralized networks. This marks a new chapter in orbital complexity and global connectivity.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-novaspace-satellites-by-year2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Novaspace data in 2025 edition Satellites to Be Built and Launched report\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/1025-cw-news-novaspace-satellites-by-year2.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Source | Novaspace</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Five mega-constellations will account for 66% of satellites launched between 2025 and 2034 yet contribute just 11% of total market value. The rise of such non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) systems and the shift away from legacy geostationary/ geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) models has largely been fueled by Starlink&rsquo;s demonstration of scalability and flexibility. Budget priorities, meanwhile, sits with defense. Defense remains the market&rsquo;s economic anchor, capturing 48% of total value despite representing just 9% of satellite volume.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<h3>Read about composites in launchers and satellites:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composites-end-markets-new-space-(2025)\" target=\"_blank\">Composites end markets: New space (2025)</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/revolutionizing-space-composites-a-new-era-of-satellite-materials\" target=\"_blank\">Revolutionizing space composites: A new era of satellite materials</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/ultra-thin-woven-fabric-enables-90-resource-reduction-in-satellite-solar-array-manufacturing\" target=\"_blank\">Ultra-thin woven fabric enables 90% resource reduction in satellite solar array manufacturing</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/low-cost-efficient-cfrp-anisogrid-lattice-structures-\" target=\"_blank\">Low-cost, efficient CFRP anisogrid lattice structures</a><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--></a><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"CFRP anisogrid lattice structure for the Vega-C interstage 2/3\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2024-CW/1024-cw-wip-cira-anisogrids-opener1.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Source | CIRA&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Looking to the launch market, the space transportation sector remains under bottleneck, with SpaceX enjoying a near-monopoly over heavy launch activity in the West.
