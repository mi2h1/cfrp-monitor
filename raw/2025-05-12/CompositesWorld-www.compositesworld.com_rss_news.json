The spacing in the peripheral positions enables high flexural rigidity with minimal use of tape. Source (All Images) |&nbsp;&copy; Porsche Engineering</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Close cooperation between Porsche Engineering (Weissach, Germany) and Porsche AG&rsquo;s (Stuttgart) material experts has resulted in the development of TABASKO, a patented tape-based carbon fiber construction method&nbsp;that can create composite components that combine maximum strength and minimum weight while also making use of post-consumer recycled materials, all in a series production process &mdash; thus supporting more sustainable automotive construction.</p>\n\n<p>The goal behind TABASKO&nbsp;(coming from German for &ldquo;tape-based carbon-fiber lightweight construction&rdquo;)&nbsp;was to achieve better material properties at a reduced weight and cost.&nbsp;Currently, many Porsche vehicle components are made of&nbsp;glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene (PP)&nbsp;called PP-GFx. Porsche wanted to consider the use of carbon fiber &mdash;&nbsp;however, carbon fiber is still a considerably expensive material. Therefore, they had the idea of reinforcing PP with strategically placed carbon fiber tapes, using less material (and thus reduced cost) and achieving thinner walls, all without sacrificing rigidity.</p>\n\n<p>Porsche&rsquo;s&nbsp;work with a supplier also supported TABASKO&rsquo;s use in series production.&nbsp;&ldquo;The question was: How can you produce up to 80,000 parts a year &mdash; in a fully automated way and cost-neutral compared to today&rsquo;s process?&rdquo; explains Frank H&auml;usler, materials expert at Porsche AG.</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Porsche-TOBASKO-strips.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Porsche-TOBASKO-strips.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Top view of the strips of tape, which are only 0.2 millimeter thick. The carbon fiber filaments run lengthwise without interruption, which increases the rigidity compared to PP-GFx by a factor of 20.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>TABASKO is fully automated and uses conventional equipment. It involves &ldquo;inserting tapes into forming tools&nbsp;by means of a handling device and attached to either the top or the bottom of the component using vacuum channels,&rdquo; so they can be easily attached to the component, an additional advantage for production costs. Successful prototype tests involving luggage trays has proven its ability to increase rigidity, reduce weight by up to 20%&nbsp;and that recycled plastics are suitable for component production.</p>\n\n<p>Six patents have been filed for TABASKO, for the material structure, the production method, the tool technology&nbsp;and the process sequence in series production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.porscheengineering.com/en/peg/newsroom/pem-2-24/stable-as-steel/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the complete story from&nbsp;<em>Porsche Engineering Magazine</em>, issue 2/2024</a>.</p>"

In March, <em>TA-2&nbsp;</em>surpassed Mach 5 during its trajectory for the second time, exceeding the previous speed record set with the December flight.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;While the team needs to complete its data review of flight two, the first flight review confirmed the robustness of the Talon-A design while demonstrating the ability to meet the full range of performance capabilities desired by our customers,&rdquo; says Dr. Zachary Krevor, president and CEO of Stratolaunch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now demonstrated hypersonic speed, added the complexity of a full runway landing with prompt payload recovery&nbsp;and proven reusability.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Supporting the U.S.&rsquo; defense initiatives, Stratolaunch is focused on expanding its hypersonic flight testing and ensuring the long-term sustainability of reusable hypersonic testbeds. These completed flights demonstrate the U.S.&rsquo; return to reusable hypersonic flight test since the X-15 program ended in 1968.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Stratolaunch-Roc-air-launch-platform-TalonA2-testbed.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0525-cw-news-Stratolaunch-Roc-air-launch-platform-TalonA2-testbed.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Stratolaunch&rsquo;s&nbsp;composites-intensive Roc air launch platform take off from Mojave Air and Space Port at Rutan Field carrying the <em>Talon-A2</em> testbed.

Boeing&rsquo;s (Arlington, Va., U.S.) April 24 announcement that it is making moves to pause the&nbsp;NASA-led&nbsp;(Washington, D.C., U.S.) project has&nbsp;been followed by <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/aeronautics/nasa-boeing-new-thin-wing-aircraft/\" target=\"_blank\">a report by the agency</a>&nbsp;that both partners are &ldquo;currently evaluating an updated approach ...&nbsp;that would focus on demonstrating thin-wing technology with broad applications for multiple aircraft configurations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To become&nbsp;NASA&rsquo;s largest X-Plane, the demonstrator was specifically focused on helping the U.S. achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050, informing future single-aisles&nbsp;with a new wing rendering &mdash; extra-long, thin wings stabilized by diagonal struts known as the transonic&nbsp;truss-braced wing (TTBW) concept. <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/nasa-picks-boeings-transonic-truss-based-wing-for-sustainable-flight-demonstrator-project\" target=\"_blank\">Boeing was working with&nbsp;NASA</a> to build, test&nbsp;and fly a full-scale version, with wing assembly&nbsp;supported by Boeing company Aurora Flight Sciences (Bridgeport, W.Va., U.S.). Though materials were never confirmed, both Boeing and Aurora have extensive composites expertise that could potentially inform the future wing design.</p>\n\n<p>According to an <em>Aviation Week</em> article, the X-66 was previously expected to fly in 2028. Now, Boeing has proposed work on the X-66 &ldquo;would pause for later consideration based on thin-wing testbed results and further truss-braced configuration studies.&rdquo;&nbsp;Under this proposal, all aspects of the X-66 flight demonstrator&rsquo;s design, as well as hardware acquired or modified for it, would be retained while the long, thin-wing technology is being investigated with more focus. NASA and Boeing would also continue to collaborate on research into the transonic truss-braced wing concept.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/emerging-technologies/boeing-puts-nasa-x-66-plan-ice-future-x-plane-fears-grow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aviation Week</em> reports</a> that from Boeing&rsquo;s perspective, this move is part of a &ldquo;pragmatic program revision,&rdquo; one that simultaneously seeks to redirect resources to certify the delayed&nbsp;737 MAX and 777-9 while avoiding &ldquo;premature commitment&nbsp;to a thin-wing configuration that may not work out in the long term.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In summary: While the X-66 program is in limbo, the thin-win seems to live on.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have learned a lot in the past few years partnering with NASA on the X-66 program that will influence the future generations of airplane design,&rdquo; a Boeing spokesperson tells <em>CW</em>. &ldquo;That learning has shown us the value of thin-wings and associated technology. Going forward, we will focus efforts on maturing the technology to support thin-wing design. What we learn with this approach can be applied across multiple products, including potential truss-braced wing configurations and beyond.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>There are still concerns that the program pause will be detrimental to the ambitious X-Plan project in the long-term. This is reinforced by the termination of the NASA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/nasa-all-electric-experimental-aircraft-to-begin-ground-testing\" target=\"_blank\">X-57</a> experimental electric aircraft in 2023, followed by the agency&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/digital-design-multi-material-structures-enable-a-quieter-supersonic-nasa-x-plane\" target=\"_blank\">X-59</a> supersonic demonstrator that is years behind schedule. But it is clear that there is still a lot to be determined. For the moment, Boeing&rsquo;s X-66 facility in Palmdale, California, is set to wind down over the next few months.</p>"

Casey Putsch, founder and president of the Genius Garage Educational Programs, as well as a car builder, racing driver, watchmaker and automotive YouTube personality, will present &ldquo;Composites enable innovative, efficient and recyclable vehicles and can help to change the nature of mass production.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The presentation will outline the Omega Car design and engineering philosophy which is centered around experimental composites for the sake of efficiency from manufacturing, its intended use&nbsp;and ultimate recyclability.&nbsp; Putsch will highlight how, through the intelligent use of composites in automotive manufacturing, he was able to engineer and build a car that has a reduced carbon footprint per mile while using a diesel internal combustion engine. Putsch designed a diesel car that achieved 104.72 miles per gallon in its first test &mdash;&nbsp;making it from New York to Los Angeles&nbsp;on one tank &mdash;&nbsp;and goes zero to 60&nbsp;in 5&nbsp;seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Putsch will also speak about this experimental project, including what is said to be&nbsp;the only full-scale flying Pterosaur model in the world.&nbsp;This is a replica of a Quetzalcoatlus Northropi using flexible membrane wings and various composite structures which created the 38-foot-wingspan flying model.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Putsch will also speak about the use of composites through his automotive builds and restorations, including a turbine powered Batmobile.&nbsp; The build used a Vietnam-era drone anti-submarine helicopter engine and replicated the hero car from the 1989 Tim Burton film.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, he will speak about the history of composites in the automotive industry, including the famous Chaparral race cars of the 1960s that inspired him to create the Omega Car and to take a blank canvas look at the automotive industry and the nature of mass production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Hybrids and electric vehicles have a purpose but they&rsquo;re not a solution for everything,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Putsch.&nbsp;&ldquo;Composite technologies can contribute to the mass production of stylish and affordable vehicles that are energy efficient and better for the environment with traditional internal combustion engines [ICE] technology.

Source |&nbsp;Quantum Fuel Systems</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://qtww.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quantum Fuel Systems LLC</a> (Lake Forest, Calif., U.S.), a vertically integrated company gaseous energy storage systems, has announced the development of a 930-bar hydrogen Type 4 cylinder, in partnership with hydrogen production, storage and distribution company <a href=\"https://oneh2.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OneH2 Inc.</a> (Longview, N.C., U.S.). These cylinders are integrated into modules by OneH2, which are then installed in hydrogen trailers for mobile refueling and gas distribution.</p>\n\n<p>Each OneH2 trailer is equipped to transport large volumes of gaseous hydrogen at high pressures to support mobile refueling of cars, trucks&nbsp;and material-handling equipment. The trailer features a configurable set of 930-bar cylinders, tailored to meet specific capacity requirements. Each cylinder can store up to 27 kilograms (gross) of automotive fuel-cell grade hydrogen, enabling a total trailer capacity of up to 486 kilograms.&nbsp;The solution eliminates&nbsp;the need for on-board compression or additional compression systems at the retail fueling site.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is no other hydrogen cylinder of this size and pressure currently certified on the market,&rdquo; claims Mark Arold, president of mobility at Quantum. &ldquo;Working closely with OneH2, we&rsquo;ve helped realize their vision and supported the hydrogen economy by advancing its supply infrastructure. Designing a safe, reliable&nbsp;and efficient over-the-road delivery system is no small feat.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The trailer&rsquo;s cylinders are designed and rigorously tested to meet international standards governing the design, construction&nbsp;and testing of Type 4 composite cylinders. They operate under a special permit issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>\n\n<p>The system also incorporates a patented cascading function that allows each cylinder to act as its own cascading bank, maximizing hydrogen use.&nbsp; &ldquo;OneH2&rsquo;s cascading technology intelligently draws from multiple cylinders to refuel vehicles, significantly reducing the amount of inaccessible hydrogen left in storage,&rdquo; explains Dhairy Patel, senior product engineer at OneH2.</p>\n\n<p>OneH2 operates a rapidly growing fleet of trailers supporting mission-critical hydrogen operations.</p>"
