Source | &ldquo;Low-temperature cure bismaleimide composite tools with excellent tool life&rdquo; presented&nbsp;by Kaneka Aerospace and Janicki</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>At CAMX 2025, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/kaneka-aerospace\" target=\"_blank\">Kaneka Aerospace</a> (Benicia, California, U.S.) and <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/janicki-industries\" target=\"_blank\">Janicki Industries</a> (Sedro-Woolley, Washington, U.S.) presented results from a joint study on Kaneka TP2230, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/low-temp-demold-bmi-prepreg-enables-low-cost-master-molds\" target=\"_blank\">newly developed</a> low-temperature-cure bismaleimide (BMI) tooling prepreg.</p>\n\n<p>These results have shown that&nbsp;TP2230 offers a major advancement over conventional BMI tooling, which typically requires a 350&deg;F (177&deg;C) cure and expensive high-temperature masters. By enabling demold at&nbsp;250&deg;F (120&deg;C) and a freestanding post-cure, TP2230 enables&nbsp;the use of more affordable master materials &mdash; reducing tooling costs and production time.</p>\n\n<p>TP2230 delivers strong mechanical properties and long-term thermal stability. Tests with aerospace-grade carbon fiber fabrics indicates&nbsp;high strength, stiffness and toughness. Microscopy has confirmed structural features that enhance damage resistance.</p>\n\n<p>In thermal aging studies, TP2230 maintained integrity with minimal weight loss and delayed microcracking, lasting several times longer than traditional BMI systems. It exhibited less than 1.2% weight loss after 10,000 hours at 350&deg;F (177&deg;C), with hints of microcrack initiation delayed until 6,000-7,500 hours. Even after 10,000 hours, cracking was limited and not close to the level of crack transfer to part or vacuum loss.</p>\n\n<p>Janicki Industries confirmed TP2230&rsquo;s ease of use and durability in tooling trials. The material showed optimal handling, smooth surface finish&nbsp;and consistent performance across multiple cycles. Tools retained vacuum integrity well beyond typical expectations, with only minor wear observed.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;By combining reduced cure temperature with long-term thermal stability, TP2230 opens new opportunities for economical, high-performance tooling,&rdquo; says Kaneka Aerospace.</p>\n\n<p>Janicki is now scaling up to larger, more complex tool geometries. &ldquo;The low-temperature initial cure of TP2230 enables&nbsp;us to streamline our tool manufacturing process, opening a pathway to reducing tooling costs and shortening production times while maintaining the high-temperature, high-durability performance of BMI tools,&rdquo; notes Todd &ldquo;TJ&rdquo; Chace, senior director of R&amp;D at Janicki. &ldquo;Backed by robust test data, it stands up to the most demanding conditions of our customers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><em>Learn more at Kaneka Aerospace&rsquo;s upcoming webinar, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/events/details/tool-smarter-repair-stronger-kanekas-low-temp-bmi-and-advanced-resin-repair-system\">Tool Smarter, Repair Stronger: Kaneka&rsquo;s Low-temp BMI and Advanced Resin Repair System</a>&rdquo; on Nov. 5, 2025.</em></p>"

The ECCA will provide a platform for knowledge sharing and cooperation, driving collective action to establish truly circular, sustainable value chains for composite materials. Alignment with European Union (EU) policy frameworks such as the Green Industrial Deal and the Circular Economy Act&nbsp;will be key to the Alliance&rsquo;s success. Through EuCIA, the ECCA has already opened a dialogue with EU policy officers.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the ECCA we aim to enable effective stakeholder engagement and build consensus within the value chain on the priority actions for the future,&rdquo; says professor Roberto Frassine, president of the EuCIA.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will set measurable, transparent targets to track progress. Alliances such as the ECCA can help shape future legislation and one of our first actions will be to provide the composites industry&rsquo;s perspective on the new Circular Economy Act.&rdquo; The Circular Economy Act, due for adoption in 2026, aims to accelerate the transition to a more circular economy and increase use of recycled materials.</p>\n\n<p>The ECCA has established five Working Groups and their first meetings took place in August. These groups are now developing their roadmaps toward circularity.</p>\n\n<p>On Dec. 4, 2025, ECCA and EuCIA members, representatives from the European Commission and the press will meet in Brussels for the Alliance&rsquo;s first General Assembly. This event will provide an opportunity to discuss the ECCA&rsquo;s goals with EU policy makers and confirm the next steps on the European composites industry&rsquo;s journey to a sustainable, circular&nbsp;and competitive future.</p>\n\n<p>JEC World 2026, taking place March 10, 12, 2026, will provide an additional opportunity&nbsp;for ECCA members to meet and review the progress achieved one year after the Alliance&rsquo;s launch.</p>\n\n<p><em>New members are welcome.

That is the driving question behind FlexCyle, a project led by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/brightlands-materials-center\" target=\"_blank\">Brightlands Materials Center</a>&nbsp;(Geleen, Netherlands) developing flexible and compact recycling solutions for thermoplastic composites (TPC).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>FlexCyle&rsquo;s consortium &mdash; TNO, CHILL, eModum, Novocycle and Poly Products&nbsp;&mdash; aims to solve this by combining shredding, compounding and extrusion-based 3D printing into one process chain. The result will be a&nbsp;flexible production line that can process TPC&nbsp;waste into functional products, right on-site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project is based at the Brightlands Chemelot Campus in South Limburg and is co-funded by the European Union through the Just Transition Fund (JTF). Partners CHILL and eModum B.V. will develop an integrated recycling line that combines shredding, compounding&nbsp;and fused granulate fabrication 3D printing (FGF 3D printing) to locally turn TPC&nbsp;waste into new, functional products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;technology will also be demonstrated by two partners via&nbsp;two practical applications: Novocycle Technologies B.V. will recycle battery casings and Poly Products B.V. will develop structural parts for a wind turbine blade bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In FlexCyle, recovered&nbsp;plastics from dismantled battery packs used in mobility applications&nbsp;are granulated and compounded, sometimes with additional fillers like glass fibers, to retain or enhance performance. The material is then used&nbsp;in direct granulate 3D printing to create custom-fit casings for second-life batteries.</p>\n\n<p>In the decommissioned wind turbine blades use case, the blades are repurposed as structural elements in bridges. FlexCycle technology is to be used to 3D print custom components that link the curved blade shapes, enabling a robust, future-proof bridge structure from upcycled materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to its technical goals, the project involves at least 12 students and creates eight new jobs at CHILL and eModum.</p>"

Source (All Images) | Atomic-6</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.atomic-6.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atomic-6</a>&nbsp;(Marietta, Ga., U.S.), a manufacturer of advanced mobility composites, introduces <a href=\"https://www.atomic-6.com/spacearmor\" target=\"_blank\">Space Armor</a> tiles &mdash; a&nbsp;radio frequency-permeable, fragmentation-resistant orbital debris shield product for spacecraft and astronauts. Its ability to resist impact while enabling mission-critical radio communications makes it well suited for&nbsp;government and commercial satellites, protecting&nbsp;the future of human space activity and ensuring responsible space stewardship.</p>\n\n<p>Satellites and astronauts are constantly threatened by millions of untrackable, hypervelocity particles in orbit, capable of traveling at velocities greater than 7 kilometers per second &mdash; nearly 16,000 miles per hour&nbsp;&mdash; and causing violent explosions on impact, which could penetrate&nbsp;fuel tanks, space suits,&nbsp;and tear&nbsp;apart batteries and structures. Traditional&nbsp;ballistic space &ldquo;Whipple shields&rdquo; that&nbsp;have existed since the 1950s have a metallic makeup, which is&nbsp;prohibitively heavy, blocks vital radio signals&nbsp;and, when impacted, can often create more debris than it stops.</p>\n\n<p>Atomic-6 has demonstrated that its Space Armor&nbsp;tiles are both orbital debris shielding and RF-permeable, enabling hypervelocity impact protection for communications devices. &ldquo;This is a big deal. We made the first radomes that can stop orbital debris,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Trevor Smith, CEO of&nbsp;Atomic-6. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to sacrifice communications to protect your spacecraft anymore. This little composite tile preserves mission-critical functions, thereby protecting spacecraft, space stations&nbsp;and people in orbit from increasingly prevalent, yet invisible threats.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/1025-cw-news-atomic6-space-armor-test.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/1025-cw-news-atomic6-space-armor-test.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a></div>\n\n<p>Demonstrated test against an aluminum shield.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Space Armor&nbsp;tiles, developed via the company&rsquo;s proprietary manufacturing process,&nbsp;are lighter and thinner than traditional Whipple shields, easy to install&nbsp;and mitigates the creation of harmful debris. As demonstrated against aluminum,&nbsp;Space Armor&nbsp;tiles successfully stop a &gt;7 kilometer/second projectile,&nbsp;producing virtually no byproducts. The aluminum equivalent shield, on the other hand, creates fragments larger than the initial projectile, and spalling debris behind the point of impact, which could damage the system it's meant to protect.</p>\n\n<p>Atomic-6 has developed two scalable protection levels in either RF-permeable or RF-blocking configurations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Space Armor Lite: Withstands debris impacts up to 3 millimeters, which accounts for all untrackable debris and more than 90% of all low-Earth orbit (LEO) debris.</li>\n\t<li>Space Armor&nbsp;Max: Built for the most extreme conditions, it resists impacts up to 12.5 millimeters, rated for human space station protection.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both variants minimize shielding mass, stowage volume, post-impact ejecta and overall mission risk.&nbsp;</p>"

As air mobility companies mature, says&nbsp;CEO Allan Wood, many engineers encounter&nbsp;difficulty in modeling complex multi-material, multilayer rotor blades.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;They [the air mobility industry] need blades with very specific shapes and performance characteristics such as inertial, elastic and strength properties,&rdquo; Wood explains. &ldquo;While air mobility engineers may have strong knowledge of composite materials and structures, blades often require specialized experience, which meant outsourcing this key component or hiring blade engineers. CompositesAI, paired with AnalySwift&rsquo;s blade modeling software, VABS, helps overcome this challenge.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As an example, an engineer could describe a helicopter or air mobility blade in natural language through the platform. &ldquo;CompositesAI translates that language into the specialized input files needed to design the blade with VABS,&rdquo; Wood explains. &ldquo;This helps engineers more quickly develop products without requiring detailed technical knowledge related to using AnalySwift&rsquo;s tools, VABS and SwiftComp.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>AnalySwift partnered with&nbsp;Wenbin Yu&nbsp;on the CompositesAI project. Yu is the Milton Clauser Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue&rsquo;s&nbsp;College of Engineering&nbsp;and AnalySwift&rsquo;s chief technology officer.</p>\n\n<p>The CompositesAI project focused on four objectives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Train CompositesAI to be an AI-powered tech support system for AnalySwift products.</li>\n\t<li>Develop a feedback mechanism so users can provide questions and answers to further improve the performance of CompositesAI.</li>\n\t<li>Develop an AI-human interactive platform so AnalySwift engineers can collaborate with CompositesAI to answer customers and automatically collect answers to further improve CompositesAI.</li>\n\t<li>Develop application programming interfaces so input files can be easily generated and companion software can be invoked for AnalySwift products.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Yu says&nbsp;CompositesAI is initially focused on rotor blades for air mobility, helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, drones and wind turbines, but its uses will expand.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It will soon be able to handle other composite structures such as plates, shells, panels and other 3D structures used by engineers in designing the next generation of aerospace, defense, energy, medical and sporting goods applications,&rdquo; he notes. &ldquo;Once fully developed, CompositesAI will be capable of handling all aspects of composites with the precision of validated engineering software and authority of world-leading experts.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>AnalySwift has partnered with Indiana-based Applied Research Institute, an economic development organization whose innovation voucher program provided matching funding to further the objectives of the partnership with Purdue. AnalySwift licenses some of its innovations through the&nbsp;Purdue Innovates Office of Technology Commercialization.</p>"
