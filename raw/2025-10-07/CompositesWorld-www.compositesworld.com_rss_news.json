Within that category, lightning damage is the largest cost center, with more than $255.7 million in repairs being undertaken in 2025. This&nbsp;is expected to escalate to more than $333 million by the end of 2034.</p>\n\n<p>Blade root failures are now the second most expensive repair for wind turbines, with more than $222.3 million in annual costs, InstelStore finds. Root insert separation is a well-known issue on certain makes and models of wind turbines, and is contributing to the cost spike for blades due to the requirement to call out a large crane for safety to remove and replace a blade with such damage.</p>\n\n<p>Pitch bearing repairs are the next most expensive category, with more than $190.9 million. Despite the fact that up-tower repairs can be made with segmented components, some machines do not have a crane-less solution for certain repairs, particularly when a full bearing swap is required.</p>\n\n<p>Making pitch bearings repairs, as well as yaw bearing or any gearbox and generator repairs fully in situ, is one of IntelStor&rsquo;s top 30 onshore wind technology trends. As for the generators, the consistency of bearings failures &mdash; brought on in part by stray currents&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;has resulted in an escalation in costs over the years for this category of repairs, a total of $190.6 million.</p>\n\n<p>Yaw bearing repairs, including slewing ring replacements, constitute more than 10%&nbsp;of total annual repair costs. As noted before, the need for a full crane call-out to lift the nacelle to perform repairs or remove bearings to the ground, continues to make turbine repairs expensive overall, and the yaw systems in particular are still a significant expense.</p>\n\n<p>IntelStore notes that&nbsp;turbines with a nameplate capacity of 1-2 megawatts (MW)&nbsp;are no longer the largest contributor to the overall repair cost breakdown at 33.1%. Rather, it is 2-3-MW turbines, which are now 52.5% of the total annual expenditure. Based on 2025 installed base data, for 1-2-MW turbines, lightning damage is the number one issue, while&nbsp;2-3-MW class blades primarily have issues with root insert failures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While IntelStore expects lightning damage to overtake root issues in the coming years for 2-3-MW wind turbines, this still underscores how impactful any repairs which necessitate significant downtime or require a crane call-out can be for an asset owner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To learn more, InstelStor offers a <a href=\"https://www.intelstor.com/store/Research-Notes-Subscription-p127663810\" target=\"_blank\">Research Notes subscription</a>.</p>"

This decision&nbsp;follows a thorough review of Boeing&rsquo;s ongoing production quality and will enable the FAA&rsquo;s&nbsp;inspectors to focus additional surveillance in the production process. The FAA will continue to maintain direct and rigorous oversight of Boeing's production processes. Boeing and the FAA will issue airworthiness certificates on alternating weeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The FAA&rsquo;s&nbsp;Organization Designation Authorization (ODA)&nbsp;program allows authorized organizations to perform certification functions on behalf of the FAA, such as issuing airworthiness and production certifications for aircraft. In May, the FAA&nbsp;renewed Boeing&rsquo;s Organization Designation Authorization (ODA)&nbsp;for 3 years effective June 1, 2025. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Resuming limited delegation to the Boeing ODA will enable FAA inspectors to provide additional surveillance in the production process. For example, there will be more FAA inspectors observing critical assembly stages, examining trends, ensuring Boeing mechanics are performing work to approved type design and engineering requirements, and assessing all activities for Boeing&rsquo;s continuous improvement of its Safety Management System (SMS). Inspectors will also observe Boeing&rsquo;s safety culture, ensuring that Boeing employees can report safety issues without fear of retribution. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The FAA stopped allowing Boeing to issue airworthiness certificates for 737 <em>Max&nbsp;</em>airplanes in 2019 during its return to service following the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes, and for Boeing 787 airplanes in 2022 because of production quality issues.&nbsp;</p>"

Moore. Source |&nbsp;University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>To avoid their disposal in landfills or recycling in high-energy, low-value industrial processes, scientists globally are developing ways to manufacture&nbsp; carbon fiber-reinforced polymer&nbsp;(CFRP) materials that allow for triggered deconstruction and&nbsp;the recovery of high-quality carbon at the end of their life span. But this promising alternative still creates a waste stream of material with little value, notes researchers at the <a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, who are exploring an innovative method using a renewable energy source to upcycle this leftover material.</p>\n\n<p>Chemistry professor Jeffrey S. Moore, and postdoctoral researchers Yuting Zhou and Zhenchuang Xu, report in their recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-025-00876-7\" target=\"_blank\">published paper</a>&nbsp;a method&nbsp;that uses electricity to modify this recycling byproduct in a way that converts it to useful material. &ldquo;This closes a critical loop in the life cycle of carbon fiber composites,&rdquo; Moore says. The research team&rsquo;s modification of this byproduct happens at the molecular level through electrolysis, a process using electric current to drive a chemical reaction in a solution.</p>\n\n<p>The recycling byproducts are basically fragments of the original material &mdash; CFRP &mdash; consisting of molecules known as oligomers, smaller chains of repeating monomer units. CFRP&nbsp;consists of cross-linked polymer matrices and carbon fiber, or networks of polymer chains that reinforce the carbon fibers. By comparison, thermoplastics consist&nbsp;of linear polymers, long chains with many repeating monomer units.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In deconstructing CFRP&nbsp;to recover the fibers, the polymer matrix is broken and leaves behind the waste fragments consisting of oligomers with low mechanical properties, Zhou explains. But through electrolysis, the researchers directly modify the oligomer backbone &mdash;&nbsp;the main structure of the polymer chain &mdash;&nbsp;at two different locations. In a single step, they modify the chain by installing two key functional groups at two carbon-hydrogen bond sites, which enables the modified oligomers to assemble into a new network formation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Those installed functional groups can link together, so we can link the fragments into a network,&rdquo; says Zhou. &ldquo;The goal is to link them [oligomers] back into a network and then restore the mechanical performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In this novel&nbsp;dynamic network form, known as covalently adaptable networks (CANS), this polymer material again has strong mechanical properties and the ability to be reprocessed.&nbsp;&ldquo;The practical significance is that we can now take low-value byproducts from composites recycling and convert them into new thermoset materials with high circularity,&rdquo; Moore says. &ldquo;This work contributes to net-zero waste manufacturing and highlights the potential of electrochemistry for polymer upcycling.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The research team also reports significant chemical advances in their study, which they say is the&nbsp;first scalable demonstration of dual carbon-hydrogen functionalization along a complex polymer backbone. Previous approaches to this type of modification have been limited to mild changes, or relied on end-group chemistry, rather than directly &ldquo;editing&rdquo; the oligomer chain itself at the carbon-hydrogen sites.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;In doing so, we found that tertiary allylic carbon-hydrogen sites in these branched oligomers are more reactive than expected, which is important new chemistry in its own right,&rdquo; Moore explains.</p>\n\n<p>The team is already pursuing further studies, including possibly extending this electrochemical method to other materials, specifically polybutadiene, a key component in synthetic rubber and high-impact polymer blends.</p>\n\n<p>This work was supported as part of the REMAT EFRC, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana&ndash;Champaign.</p>\n\n<p>The paper was published in <em>Nature Synthesis</em> and can be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-025-00876-7\" target=\"_blank\">accessed here</a>.</p>"

Source |&nbsp;Seoul National University of Science and Technology</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Researchers from the <a href=\"https://en.seoultech.ac.kr/\" target=\"_blank\">Seoul National University of Science and Technology</a> (South Korea) have developed highly stretchable <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2025.119614\" target=\"_blank\">CNT nanocomposites</a>, optimized specifically for vat photopolymerization (VPP)-type 3D printing. Using these materials, they also developed a wearable smart-insole sensing platform for real-time foot pressure monitoring.</p>\n\n<p>Polymer-based conductive nanocomposites, particularly those incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are reported to be highly promising for the development of flexible electronics, soft robotics and wearable devices. However,&nbsp;CNTs are difficult to work with as they tend to agglomerate, making it hard to obtain a uniform dispersion. Moreover, conventional methods limit control over CNT distribution and shape.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome these challenges, researchers are turning to 3D printing methods, such as VPP, which offer greater design freedom with high printing accuracy. In this method, a light is used to selectively cure and harden layers of an ink within a vat, gradually building a 3D object. Despite its advantages, it also poses several challenges. The presence of CNTs affects the printability and curing properties of the inks. Moreover, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve&nbsp;high stretchability and electrical conductivity.</p>\n\n<p>Now, a research team led by professor Keun Park and associate professor Soonjae Pyo from the Department of Mechanical System Design Engineering at Seoul National University of Science and Technology&nbsp;has successfully fabricated highly stretchable, electrically conductive CNT nanocomposites, using VPP-type 3D printing. &ldquo;Our CNT nanocomposites&nbsp;enable the fabrication of highly complex 3D structures,&rdquo; explains Park. &ldquo;We also used these materials to additively&nbsp;manufacture new piezoresistive sensors and integrate them&nbsp;into a wearable health monitoring device.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Their study was made available online on Aug.&nbsp;25, 2025, and will be published in&nbsp;vol.&nbsp;372 of <em><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2025.119614\" target=\"_blank\">Composite Structures</a></em> on Nov. 15, 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The team first prepared polymer nanocomposite inks by uniformly dispersing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into an aliphatic urethane diacrylate (AUD) resin, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 weight%. To achieve uniform dispersion, they agitated the mixture using ultrasonic waves. The prepared inks were then analyzed to determine the optimal printing conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Next, the team additively manufactured test specimens using the various inks and tested them for their mechanical and electrical properties, as well as printing resolution (the minimum thickness that can be printed). Results showed that the formulation with 0.9 weight% CNT offered the best balance of properties. It could stretch up to 223% of its original length before breaking, while still achieving a high electrical conductivity of 1.64 &times; 10<sup>&minus;3 </sup>S/m, surpassing that of previously reported materials. It also achieved a printing resolution of 0.6 millimeter.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate practical applicability, Korean researchers used the optimized CNT nanocomposites to 3D flexible triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS)-based piezoresistive sensors&nbsp;that showed high sensitivity and reliable performance. Importantly, they integrated these sensors into an insole to create a smart-insole platform. Using this platform, the team could monitor the pressure distribution at the bottom of the foot in real time, detecting different human movements and postures.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We believe these materials will be indispensable for wearable health monitors, flexible electronics and smart textiles,&rdquo; reiterates Pyo.</p>"

The kick-off meeting of this new sectorial alliance of EuCIA took place on Sept. 3 in Brussels.</p>\n\n<p>Fiber-reinforced composite rebar is a competitive, performing and reliable alternative to steel in the building, construction and infrastructure Industries and offers a significant market opportunity for composite materials. The ERC aims to promote the adoption of composite rebar in Europe by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Driving standardization and certification efforts</li>\n\t<li>Facilitating industry collaboration and knowledge sharing</li>\n\t<li>Engaging in policy advocacy at EU and national levels</li>\n\t<li>Educating stakeholders on benefits and applications.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We warmly welcome the ERC members to EuCIA,&rdquo; says Roberto Frassine, president of EuCIA. &ldquo;Our mission for the last 65 years has been to support the growth of the European composites industry and the emerging market for composite rebar offers potential for our industry. We are confident that this new alliance will support the move to more sustainable construction practices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>During the kick-off meeting, Chris Skinner, VP strategic marketing and&nbsp;R&amp;D at <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/owens-corning\" target=\"_blank\">Owens Corning</a>, was elected chair of the alliance, and Alise Novikova, co-owner, <a href=\"https://rebarmat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rebarmat</a>, as vice chair.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The formation of this Council marks a significant milestone in our journey to make infrastructure across Europe more durable, sustainable and future-ready through the use of composites,&rdquo; states Skinner. &ldquo;As the voice of the European composites industry, EuCIA was the obvious home for the ERC. I express my sincere gratitude to EuCIA and JEC Group for their support. Their leadership and commitment to advancing composite solutions have been crucial in bringing together key stakeholders from across the value chain.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Four working groups have been established to drive the Council&rsquo;s activities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Standards &amp; Certification</li>\n\t<li>Market Development &amp; Promotion</li>\n\t<li>Sustainability &amp; Circularity</li>\n\t<li>Public Policy &amp; Advocacy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The working groups will meet over the coming weeks to prepare for the next ERC meeting in October 2025.&nbsp;The ERC will share news through its <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-rebar-council/\" target=\"_blank\">Linkedin page</a>. A website will be launched by the end of the year.</p>"
