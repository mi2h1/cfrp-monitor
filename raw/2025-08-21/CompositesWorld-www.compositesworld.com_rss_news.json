One of these patents allows machines to switch between materials, laying down continuous fiber composites in true 3D form. This enables us to align fibers with load directions, producing lighter, stronger structures with less material.&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash; Eric Barnes, in 2024&nbsp;<em>Breaking Defense</em> article</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We also incorporated Plasma Arc Directed Energy Deposition [using] titanium for some of the primary structure of the wing,&rdquo; said Barnes, &ldquo;which we believe was the first time this process was used in a defense primary structural application. Through this we are seeing a 30% reduction in cost and schedule timelines for these parts, compared to traditional processes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Digital thread, determinate assembly</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Sarah Beaudin, DPF director at Northrop Grumman, noted in the <em>Breaking Defense</em> article that in today&rsquo;s world, the ability to deliver high-tech, high-end aircraft/aerospace solutions within tighter timelines is imperative. &ldquo;Digital engineering makes that possible,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Our digital environment provides near-real-time visibility, creating a single source of truth. This allows us to adopt a shift-left approach &mdash; iterating everything from design through sustainment as early as possible in the program. By the time we actually start building things, we&rsquo;ve already got it right.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We integrated suppliers into the digital transformation collaborative toolset,&rdquo; Barnes explained. &ldquo;This was a game-changer in many ways. To perform determinant assembly effectively, we need to push digital collaboration down to our suppliers, integrating them into our digital toolsets.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This capability reduced not only the timeline but also costs. &ldquo;Typical programs budget 15-20% for engineering rework,&rdquo; said Beaudin. &ldquo;We saw less than 1%. In addition, we saw improved efficiencies on the manufacturing floor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Just as the power of collaboration has been demonstrated by Digital Pathfinder in the <em>Model 437</em> platform, Beacon will reportedly do the same for autonomy. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;By providing open access to the Beacon ecosystem, we&rsquo;re enhancing the innovation, new competition and ultimately the autonomous capabilities that industry can deliver to our customers, with unmatched speed and at scale,&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash; Tom Jones, corporate vice president and president, Aeronautics Systems, Northrop Grumman.</p>\n</blockquote>"

Source | SGL Carbon</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Increasing uncertainty about the future development of global trade, tariff increases between the U.S. and Europe, and weak demand in some of its markets have weighed on <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/sgl-carbon-se\" target=\"_blank\">SGL Carbon</a>&rsquo;s (Wiesbaden, Germany) sale and performance for the first half of 2025. On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/sgl-carbon-makes-decision-to-restructure-carbon-fibers-business\" target=\"_blank\">restructuring</a> of SGL&rsquo;s Carbon Fibers business unit is showing initial signs of success. After 6 months of fiscal 2025, SGL Carbon generated sales of &euro;453.2 million, down 15.8% on the previous year (H1 2024: &euro;538.0 million).</p>\n\n<p>The group&rsquo;s decline in sales is&nbsp;primarily attributable to negative volume effects, while currency and price effects played only a minor role. In particular, the ongoing weak demand from SGL&rsquo;s semiconductor customers in the Graphite Solutions business unit weighed on sales development. Furthermore, the Carbon Fibers business unit reported lower sales as a result of the discontinuation of unprofitable business activities as part of the company&rsquo;s restructuring.</p>\n\n<p>While this unit&rsquo;s restructuring did result in some cost savings, and there was a&nbsp;slight improvement in adjusted EBITDA in SGL&rsquo;s&nbsp;Process Technology business unit, these&nbsp;developments were unable to offset the shortfall in earnings contributions from the decline in the high-margin semiconductor business. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 16.2% compared to the first half of 2024 to &euro;72.5 million (H1 2024: &euro;86.5 million). The adjusted EBITDA margin remained almost unchanged at 16.0% compared to the previous year (H1 2024: 16.1%).</p>\n\n<p>Taking into account depreciation and amortization of &euro;25.8 million (H1 2024: &euro;27.0 million) and non-recurring and special items of &euro;-49.9 million (H1 2024: &euro;3.6 million), EBIT for the first half of 2025 amounted to &euro;3.2 million (H1 2024: &euro;55.9 million). The non-recurring and special items result in particular from restructuring expenses of &euro;47.0 million.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>SGL business units</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Graphite Solutions (GS)</strong> business unit reported sales of &euro;221.0 million in the first half of 2025, down 22.2% on the same period of the previous year (H1 2024: &euro;284.2 million). This significant decline in sales is primarily attributable to lower demand in the Semiconductor and&nbsp;LED market segment, which saw a significant drop in sales of &euro;63.4 million to &euro;78.4 million (H1 2024: &euro;141.8 million).</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our customers&rsquo;&nbsp;demand for graphite components for the semiconductor industry is a key driver of sales and earnings for the entire SGL Carbon business,&rdquo; explains Andreas Klein, CEO of SGL Carbon and head of the GS business unit.&nbsp;&ldquo;As expected, demand was weak in the first half of 2025 due to continued high inventory levels at our customers. In addition, Western electric vehicle [EV] manufacturers in particular postponed market launches of new vehicle models with silicone carbide&nbsp;[SiC] semiconductor structures. We generally expect demand to pick up again once our customers have reduced their inventories, but it will continue to be driven by EV&nbsp;sales figures in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The significant decline in sales in the high-margin business with SiC semiconductor customers had a negative impact on GS&rsquo;&nbsp;adjusted EBITDA. Compared to the same period last year, this business unit&rsquo;s&nbsp;adjusted EBITDA decreased to &euro;40.8 million (H1 2024: &euro;72.2 million). Measures initiated to reduce personnel and energy costs only partially offset the volume-related decline. The adjusted EBITDA margin decreased significantly to 18.5% in a 6-month comparison (H1 2024: 25.4%).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;SGL Carbon is not immune to the economic environment or developments in our sales markets&hellip;&nbsp;[but] we will continue to optimize our cost structures and work on developing new market segments.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With sales of &euro;70.2 million, slightly up on the same period of the previous year (H1 2024: &euro;69.9 million), the <strong>Process Technology (PT) </strong>business unit confirmed the stability of its business activities. PT benefited in particular from its global customer base, especially in Q1 2025. The completion of several major projects was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA. This increased from &euro;16.0 million in the same period of the previous year to &euro;19.9 million. Higher capacity utilization and positive cost effects for raw materials led to an improvement in the adjusted EBITDA margin from 22.9% in the first half of 2024 to 28.3% in the first half of 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The restructuring announced in February 2025 showed initial success in the first half of 2025, with positive adjusted EBITDA for SGL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>Carbon Fibers (CF)</strong> business unit. The discontinuation of loss-making business activities resulted in a 15.1% decline in sales to &euro;93.5 million (H1 2024: &euro;110.1 million) but also led to an increase in adjusted EBITDA for CF from &euro;-4.4 million to &euro;5.2 million year-on-year.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As part of the CF restructuring, production at our site in Lavradio [Portugal], which mainly produced acrylic fibers and precursors for carbon fibers, was closed down,&rdquo; says Dr. Stephan B&uuml;hler, member of the executive board responsible for this area.&nbsp;&ldquo;Production and consequently also our business activities in the acrylic fibers and precursors product areas were completely discontinued at the end of June 2025. CF will focus in future on profitable products with greater differentiation from the international competition.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the adjusted EBITDA of the CF business unit includes an earnings contribution of &euro;4.7 million from its equity-accounted joint venture BSCCB (H1 2024: &euro;7.9 million). The decline in BSCCB&rsquo;s earnings contribution is due to the costs of expanding production capacity and volatile demand from automotive customers. Excluding the earnings contribution of the equity-accounted BSCCB, adjusted EBITDA for CF would have been &euro;0.5 million (H1 2024: &euro;-12.3 million).</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Composite Solutions (CS) </strong>business unit was also unable to avoid the increasing uncertainty in the automotive industry about future growth prospects. CS sales declined by 11.7% to &euro;59.1 million in the first half of 2025 (H1 2024: &euro;66.9 million). It should be noted that the first 6&nbsp;months of the previous year still included sales from a contract with an automotive customer that expired in Q2 2024.</p>\n\n<p>As a result of lower volumes and the associated lower use of production capacities, CS&rsquo;s&nbsp;adjusted EBITDA decreased by &euro;2.7 million to &euro;5.4 million (H1 2024: &euro;8.1 million) compared to the same period last year. Accordingly, the adjusted EBITDA margin of CS declined to 9.1% (H1 2024: 12.1%).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<strong>Outlook for the rest of 2025</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Increasing trade barriers, especially due to U.S. tariff policy, are having a negative impact on the business development of SGL&rsquo;s customers and sales markets. In particular, the high level of uncertainty about future developments in the automotive industry is currently weighing on demand for its&nbsp;products. This also includes expected sales of EVs, which are the main drivers of demand for SiC&nbsp;semiconductors. Special graphite components from SGL Carbon are required to manufacture these high-performance semiconductors.</p>\n\n<p>In light of the current economic environment, the company&rsquo;s expectations for developments in its&nbsp;sales markets in the upcoming months, and taking into account its restructuring measures within its CF&nbsp;business unit, SGL has adjusted its&nbsp;sales forecast for fiscal year 2025. The company now expects consolidated sales for the full fiscal year 2025 to decline by 10-15% compared with the previous year (2024: &euro;1,026.4 million). Previously, SGL Carbon had expected sales to decrease by up to 10% (slight decline) compared with the previous year.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the discontinuation of loss-making business activities in the CF business unit and cost savings as part of the successful restructuring and associated improvement in profitability, the forecast for the group&rsquo;s adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2025 remains unchanged in the range of &euro;130-150 million.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;SGL Carbon is not immune to the economic environment or developments in our sales markets,&rdquo; notes Thomas Dippold, CFO of SGL Carbon. &ldquo;But we have taken measures to stabilize SGL Carbon&rsquo;s profitability. The measures already implemented as part of the CF&nbsp;restructuring are showing initial signs of success, and for the first time in many quarters, adjusted EBITDA for CF business unit is positive again. But we are not satisfied yet. We will continue to optimize our cost structures and work on developing new market segments.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Further details on business development in the first half of 2025 can be found in the half-year report on SGL&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sglcarbon.com/en/investor-relations/publications-news-key-figures/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>"

Accessible in <a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202404702\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Advanced Energy Materials</em></a>, researchers&nbsp;intend for the paper to&nbsp;set the groundwork for formal standard methods to be developed, which are vital for industry to assess, contrast and potentially adopt these emerging materials in future products.</p>\n\n<p>SPCs&nbsp;could have a profound impact on the future direction of composites. By tailoring the constituents and composite architecture, researchers have developed &ldquo;structural supercapacitors&rdquo; and &ldquo;structural batteries.&rdquo;&nbsp;These are not only electrochemical energy storage devices but also structural materials that go <em>beyond</em> smart structures &mdash;&nbsp;rather than embedding an electrochemical cell into a composite laminate (a battery in a structure) the groups&rsquo; SPCs can intrinsically&nbsp;undertake two roles simultaneously (structural battery).</p>\n\n<p>It has been found that SPCs not only&nbsp;deliver lightweighting and efficient energy storage, but also offer a novel approach to composite design and innovation. For instance, it has been shown that SPC floor panels could power the seatback entertainment units in future electric aircraft, considerably reducing electrical wiring and providing weight and volume savings. This could also translate into more&nbsp;ubiquitous applications as well: phones, cars, computers, medical devices, infrastructure and so on. Moreover, the World Economic Forum has&nbsp;recognized SPCs are one of the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/publications/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/in-full/structural-battery-composites/\" target=\"_blank\">Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But as with any emerging technology, particularly one which draws together very different disciplines (i.e., structural composites and electrochemistry), there are no standards for characterization and reporting. The conventions, nomenclature and standards followed by conventional electrochemical and mechanical (composite) fields are very different and combining them has proved to be challenging.</p>\n\n<p>Through this paper, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.202404702\" target=\"_blank\">Characterization and Reporting Protocols for Structural Power Composites: A Perspective</a>,&rdquo; researchers&nbsp;have sought to rectify this. This includes recommendations that the&nbsp;multifunctional performance of SPCs be reported, but that this performance should also be contrasted against monofunctional benchmarks &mdash; conventional composites and electrochemical cells that use some of the same constituents. Recommendations have also been made for&nbsp;reporting device performance, to ensure that the published data uses the same protocols for normalization by mass or volume, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the paper&rsquo;s most important findings is the need for a universal coupon (see opening image), in which both mechanical and electrochemical characterization can be undertaken. In fact, such a coupon should permit simultaneous mechanical and electrochemical characterization, as the material would be used in practice. This would mean the &ldquo;multifunctional performance&rdquo;&nbsp;could be credibly declared and any coupling phenomena (such as mechanical strain influencing electrochemical behavior) identified. Realization of such an universal coupon, and widespread adoption of this protocol, would deliver much more reliable and convincing data for SPCs, and underpin the material development and industrialization.</p>"

Supported by Future Innovation Research in Space Transportation (FIRST!), a Space Transportation (ESA STS)&nbsp;Future Launchers Preparatory Program (FLPP) initiative, Smartbeam&rsquo;s main objective is to create affordable and scalable manufacturing methods to enable the production of off-the-shelf smart composite structures for space applications. Through this, project partners aimed to develop and test a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP)&nbsp;beam with an embedded health monitoring system (HMS).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The project focused&nbsp;on two key goals: a universal manufacturing process, and an embedded HMS. Partners wanted to develop a universal process for producing CFRP trusses that allows manufacturing tubes with an integrated HMS in a wide range of dimensions (length, internal diameter, wall thickness and fiber orientation) at an attractive cost. Implementation of an HMS would enable real-time structural monitoring&nbsp;without significantly increasing manufacturing costs or compromising mechanical performance.</p>\n\n<p>Why was this development important for space structure applications? Technologies like Smartbeam&nbsp;are highly relevant in that it can&nbsp;significantly reduce inspection times by providing real-time structural health data. In reusable launchers, this minimizes ground time between launches. In spacecraft, it enables immediate identification of issues in orbit and targeted repairs or replacements of affected trusses, saving cost&nbsp;and reducing environmental impact by avoiding unnecessary disposal of undamaged components.</p>\n\n<p>CompoTech was responsible for developing the universal manufacturing process to produce CFRP tubes with integrated HMS. This process needed to accommodate various geometries and dimensions while ensuring consistent product quality and maintaining competitive costs.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-smartbeam-project-1.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></div>\n\n<div class=\"centered g-img\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-smartbeam-project-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><!--[if IE 9]><video style='display: none;'><![endif]--> <source media=\"(min - width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(min - width: 401px) and (max-width: 1000px)\" /> <source media=\"(max-width: 400px)\" /> <!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]--> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0725-cw-news-smartbeam-project-3.jpg;maxWidth=720\" /> </a>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>OHB Czechspace&nbsp;acted as the project leader and provided expertise on the space industry&rsquo;s technical requirements for structural components.&nbsp;CVUT FS was in charge of designing and preparing HMS sensors for integration. It also conducted mechanical testing and nondestructive evaluation of samples.</p>\n\n<p>In this project, CompoTech successfully developed the technology to integrate the optical measuring fibers used for the Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) method. This method is able to measure strain at points about 2.6&nbsp;millimeters apart along the entire length of the optical fiber. Carbon fiber sensors&nbsp;were also integrated to enable impaction detection.</p>\n\n<p>The carbon fiber sensors were incorporated directly during the filament winding process. They were placed between two layers of glass fabric prepreg to provide electrical insulation from the CFRP laminate. Optical fibers were positioned parallel to the carbon fiber sensors to simplify handling. The sensors were equipped with custom connectors, creating a plug-and-play interface that enables easy connection after manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>The winding process itself became a technical hurdle during Smartbeam&rsquo;s development when determining how to prepare the sensors. The challenge, CompoTech explains,&nbsp;lay in precisely placing the connectors&nbsp;and meeting the high-temperature resistance requirements.&nbsp;Another issue that had to be solved was sealing the connectors against resin ingress during production.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome this, the&nbsp;team developed several design iterations and practical tooling to support sensor handling and placement, and multiple versions of connector housings were prototyped and tested.&nbsp;Special 3D printed fixtures were made for the connectors, and a connection interface with connectors was integrated so that no additional assembly was necessary after the profiles were wound. The filament winding process was also adapted to precisely position the sensors and ensure even coverage of their connectors, with modifications that prevented resin leakage around the connectors, and met requirements for thermal resistance, sealing&nbsp;and consistent laminate coverage.</p>\n\n<p>Upon completion, the project delivered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A verified manufacturing process for producing smart composite profiles with integrated sensors.</li>\n\t<li>Integrated connector interfaces eliminating post-production assembly steps.</li>\n\t<li>Solutions for resin sealing during curing.</li>\n\t<li>Verified sensor performance in mechanical and thermal tests.</li>\n\t<li>Initial evidence that carbon fiber sensors can detect impact under certain conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Correct functioning of the sensors was verified during mechanical tests in compression and bending. Initial information was obtained regarding the possibility of using a carbon sensor for impaction detection on this type of wound profile during impactions. Partners agree that, compared to traditional composites manufacturing, the Smartbeam approach simplifies integration of HMS&nbsp;and reduces time and cost for system assembly, making it well suited to reusable launcher structures, spacecraft components&nbsp;and ground support equipment.</p>\n\n<p>The next goal of the project is to increase TRL to at least 4 via breadboard validation in a laboratory environment.</p>"
