This material improves rocket performance by increasing launch vehicle payload capability while reducing production&nbsp;costs compared to industry standard metal-based nozzle extensions.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Firefly&rsquo;s expertise in carbon [fiber] composites and rocket propulsion puts us in a position to develop a composite-based nozzle extension that allow us to reduce mass on our launch vehicles and ultimately increase payload capacity for customers,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace. &ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve seen with Firefly&rsquo;s carbon [fiber] composite barrels, domes&nbsp;and tanks, composites provide a cost-efficient, lightweight solution that improves performance.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Second stage nozzle extensions have historically been produced with metals that are often heavy, expensive to manufacture, and reliant on non-domestic sources of raw material. As an alternative, CMC&nbsp;can offer significant cost and mass savings with higher strength at relevant temperature ranges. In fact, Firefly&rsquo;s composite material solution is expected to reduce the mass of nozzle extensions by more than 50%, unlocking additional performance and payload capability. In addition, use of composite materials&nbsp;offers significant lead time reduction from months to weeks with domestically available materials and a rapid spin form production process. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Firefly says it will use its its expertise to rapidly design, build&nbsp;and test a composite-based nozzle extension to validate the material. Once developed and validated, the composite nozzle extensions will enable future responsive space applications that support U.S. national security and the larger commercial space industry. Firefly also plans to use the composite nozzle extension fabrication methods for its second stage engines, Lightning and Vira, that power Firefly&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Alpha</em> rocket&nbsp;and medium launch vehicle (MLV), respectively.</p>"

PCRs are critical frameworks that define how to assess the environmental impacts of functionally equivalent products, helping manufacturers deliver clear, standardized&nbsp;and comparable environmental information.</p>\n\n<p>The development of the PCR followed a rigorous, multistep process to ensure compliance with international and federal standards. Expert reviewers confirmed that the draft PCR aligned with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines and met the criteria established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for PCR development. Following a period of public consultation, the PCR was finalized and officially published.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Manufacturers of composite platforms and stairways can now create EPDs that empower architects, builders and customers to make informed, sustainable choices in their construction projects,&rdquo; says Cindy Squires Esq., president and CEO of ACMA. &ldquo;It will provide a clear path to developing EDPs, enabling them to communicate the environmental impacts of their products transparently and credibly.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This accomplishment builds upon ACMA&rsquo;s broader sustainability initiatives, including the development of PCRs for other composite applications like rebar, which is currently in progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For more information about ACMA&rsquo;s sustainability efforts and access to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://acmanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Part_B_Product_Group_Definition_Industrial_Stairways_Platforms_2025.pdf?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=357900512&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9UWhSstIJHjtKJ8TdnEXNaGPHr8goTdEF8n2URi49lEpKN-5LWAUQWq9cab01rdrlSXIfnL-UW1MD5xAkccyVHtg4JFQ\" target=\"_blank\">new PCR</a>, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://acmanet.org/sustainability/circle/?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=357900512&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9UWhSstIJHjtKJ8TdnEXNaGPHr8goTdEF8n2URi49lEpKN-5LWAUQWq9cab01rdrlSXIfnL-UW1MD5xAkccyVHtg4JFQ\" target=\"_blank\">acmanet.org/circle</a>.</p>"

GWEC&rsquo;s flagship annual report is a&nbsp;key tool for anyone taking part in the energy transition. It&nbsp;provides a comprehensive overview of the <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/gwec-releases-2024-global-offshore-wind-report\" target=\"_blank\">wind industry&rsquo;s performance in 2024</a> and outlines the pathway to accelerated growth.</p>\n\n<p>The report opens with key data and narrative insights before exploring major trends shaping the sector, including financial headwinds, trade barriers, supply chain constraints&nbsp;and challenges such as grid integration, auction design&nbsp;and public acceptance.</p>\n\n<p>It then presents solutions to scale wind deployment, focusing on investment de-risking, standardization, trade collaboration&nbsp;and strategies to build political and social support. A detailed review of emerging and strategic markets follows, with regional spotlights on Africa, Asia-Pacific, Central Asia, Europe, MENA&nbsp;and the Americas.</p>\n\n<p>The report also includes current market status and a forward-looking outlook to 2029. Supporting sections detail GWEC&rsquo;s methodology, market intelligence approach&nbsp;and initiatives on leadership and gender diversity.</p>\n\n<p>According to the 2025 report, the 117 gigawatts of wind installed in 2024 has continued to advance this industry into&nbsp;new geographies. However, this momentum, as mentioned in years past, is still not enough. GWEC says that to deliver the&nbsp;full benefits of wind energy, and align with COP28&rsquo;s agreement to&nbsp;triple global renewable capacity by 2030, wind deployment must scale rapidly (<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/gwec-releases-2024-global-offshore-wind-report\" target=\"_blank\">compare this report to 2024&rsquo;s</a>).</p>\n\n<p>A few key insights include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>An emerging markets surge: Uzbekistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others are becoming new growth centers for wind deployment.</li>\n\t<li>Policy momentum: Legislative and regulatory reforms in the U.K., Germany, South Africa, Brazil and across Asia-Pacific signal rising political will.</li>\n\t<li>Grid and supply chain bottlenecks: Modernization of electricity grids and supply chains is crucial to keeping pace with demand.</li>\n\t<li>Disinformation risk: Misinformation campaigns are eroding public trust and creating permitting delays in key markets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reports offers a roadmap that GWEC hopes will lay&nbsp;the foundation to scale from today&rsquo;s growth trajectory to the 320 gigawatts&nbsp;per year needed by 2030.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gwec.net/reports/globalwindreport\" target=\"_blank\">Download the complete report here</a>.</p>"

Source | CEAD, Haddy</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.haddy.life/\" target=\"_blank\">Haddy</a> (St. Petersburg, Fla., U.S.), a sustainable design and manufacturing company, has officially opened a&nbsp;new large-format 3D printing microfactory in Florida. The facility was realized in close collaboration with Netherlands-based large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM) solutions provider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/cead-bv\" target=\"_blank\">CEAD</a>&nbsp; (Delft), which provided and installed the LFAM technology powering the microfactory.</p>\n\n<p>Driven by eight Flexbot robotic 3D printing systems with integrated CNC postprocessing capabilities, Haddy&rsquo;s&nbsp;facility is meant to be &ldquo;one of the largest and most powerful 3D printing facilities of its kind globally&rdquo; according to CEAD. The company&rsquo;s Flexbot, for example, is designed for fully automated, end-to-end manufacturing of large composite parts and within this microfactory, it represents a leap forward in localized, digital production of short fiber-reinforced thermoplastic components and structures.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;For CEAD, this marks a significant milestone in enabling customers with localized, fully integrated manufacturing,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Lucas Janssen, CEO and co-founder of CEAD. &ldquo;This microfactory is a testament to what CEAD and our team can achieve, delivering advanced technology at scale, but it&rsquo;s also a showcase of what&rsquo;s possible when visionary companies like Haddy embrace this technology to drive local production and real-word impact.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Haddy&rsquo;s investment in CEAD&rsquo;s modular and flexible technology underscores a growing demand in the U.S. for localized and more agile production. Starting with just two Flexbot systems in 2022, the company has since scaled to eight Flexbot systems. Powered by AI, the factory now has 16 times the production capacity of its nearest 3D printing competitor. Initially focused on furniture, the technology allows the company to expand into other high-impact sectors, producing high-performance components for industries including construction, disaster recovery&nbsp;and beyond.</p>\n\n<p>That Haddy is deeply rooted in its local community, was evident during the inauguration of the facility. The event was a warm embrace toward members of the local community, with the event attended by key municipal representatives and team members of CEAD, including those who completed the final&nbsp;stages of the project.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Seeing the products Haddy has already been producing over the past two years, and meeting some of the customers who now rely on them, was rewarding.&rdquo; Janssen adds. &ldquo;Tt was great to have our own team members on-site to celebrate this achievement together. We also had the opportunity to connect with several industry partners for engaging discussions, especially around extending this technology to maritime applications.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>This microfactory concept aligns with CEAD&rsquo;s broader vision: enabling manufacturers worldwide to automate the production of large, complex parts locally, efficiently&nbsp;and with minimal environmental impact.&nbsp;</p>"

Source | Wickert</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>Since 2024, what <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/wickert-hydraulic-presses-usa\" target=\"_blank\">Wickert</a> (Landau, Germany) contends is the world&rsquo;s fastest heating/cooling&nbsp;press has been in operation at the Institute of Lightweight Structures (IST), part of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at <a href=\"https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en\" target=\"_blank\">Chemnitz University of Technology</a>&nbsp;(Germany). With its high tempering speeds, the Wickert&nbsp;WKP 3000 S has been enabling the university scientists to process high-performance&nbsp;thermoplastics such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) in record time.</p>\n\n<p>The team, led by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Nendel, is researching how structural components and hybrid components made of plastics, like fiber-reinforced composites,&nbsp;and metal can be manufactured using near-series production processes. Their focus is on structural&nbsp;components for aerospace, automotive&nbsp;and electromobility. Typical applications include tanks for hydrogen systems, battery carriers for electric vehicles, crash-relevant car parts for front- and rear-ends, and drainage and manhole systems for the construction industry.</p>\n\n<p>Another field of research concerns thermoplastic carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRTP)&nbsp;profiles for aircraft components. Chemnitz scientists&nbsp;are investigating how these high-performance materials can be processed in cost-effective, large-scale production. The focus here is on materials that can replace standard polymers such as PP and PE as well as engineering plastics such as PA, PC, POM and PET when they reach their performance limits. Wickert&rsquo;s hydraulic press is helping them to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;WKP 3000 S achieves peak temperatures of up to 450&deg; C across the entire 600 &times;&nbsp;600-millimeter pressing area. It currently delivers heating rates of 55 Kelvin/minute and cooling rates of up to 100 Kelvin/minute. The maximum deviation over the entire surface is less than 5&deg;C.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the press&nbsp;reaches its full press force of 3,000 kilonewtons&nbsp;in under one second. The plane parallelism, less than 0.1 millimeter, and a maximum lateral offset of 0.02 millimeter enable processing with a high&nbsp;level of precision.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Wickert&nbsp;press &mdash; in particular, its&nbsp;extreme speeds of temperature control &mdash; have added value in [our] research,&rdquo; Nendel says. &ldquo;This allows us to design test series much more effectively and create many more samples in the shortest possible time.&rdquo; A production cycle that takes a few minutes on the Wickert press would take over an hour on a normal press, for example.</p>"

Archer&rsquo;s goal is to enable passengers to travel from Manhattan to nearby airports in just 5-15 minutes using <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-rolls-out-first-midnight-aircraft-prepares-for-flight-testing\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Midnight</em></a>, the company&rsquo;s electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) platform, in order to dramatically reduce&nbsp;travel times compared to traditional ground transportation and help&nbsp;avoid the city&rsquo;s notorious traffic.</p>\n\n<p><em>Midnight</em>, featuring a composites-intensive <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-unveils-production-aircraft-midnight\" target=\"_blank\">design</a>,&nbsp;can carry up to four passengers while producing less noise and emissions than a traditional helicopter. <em>Midnight</em> is built with redundant systems across the aircraft &mdash;including 12 total engines and propellers &mdash; enabling Archer to target similar levels of safety as commercial airliners. Archer is building <em>Midnight</em> at manufacturing facilities in San Jose, California,&nbsp;and Covington, Georgia.</p>\n\n<p>Archer will look to use existing aviation properties around the region, with a goal of establishing vertiports associated with airports and helipads in the area.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-l font-weight-light g-img m-r-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0425-cw-news-archer-midnight-render-nyc1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Midnight aircraft render over NYC.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/cw/2025-cw/0425-cw-news-archer-midnight-render-nyc1.png;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The company continues work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to earn earn the aircraft&rsquo;s type certification. Once received, Archer&nbsp;and its operating partners plan to safely and seamlessly integrate <em>Midnight</em> into service, beginning with major airports like those in the NYC area. Archer received its FAA Part 135 Air Carrier and Operator certificate <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/archer-announces-part-135-certification-to-begin-operating-commercial-aircraft\" target=\"_blank\">in June 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Under this concept of operations, passengers would book Archer flights as a complement to traditional airline travel, reducing door-to-door travel times. United previously placed an order for a fleet of Archer&rsquo;s <em>Midnight</em> aircraft and has remained a long-time investor in the company.</p>\n\n<p>Archer is also working closely with existing infrastructure partners, including Atlantic Aviation, Signature Aviation and Skyports/GroupeADP, as well as new partners Modern Aviation and Air Pegasus, to develop and electrify aviation assets in this proposed network.

In addition, this technology can be used to enhance a composite material&rsquo;s properties&nbsp;in through-the-thickness direction and to improve the performance of bonded joints in composite assemblies, as well as improving the repair and healing of the damaged composite parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-image fl-r font-weight-light g-img m-l-2 m-t-1 text-muted text-sm\">\n<div><a class=\"js-lightbox\" href=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-WSU-nanotechnology-3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Dr. Davood Askari.\" src=\"https://d2n4wb9orp1vta.cloudfront.net/cms/brand/CW/2025-CW/0425-cw-news-WSU-nanotechnology-3.jpg;maxWidth=385\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>Dr. Davood Askari.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Traditional composite materials often struggle with delamination and poor bonding between layers,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Askari. &ldquo;Our technology enhances the interlocking between components at the nanoscale, which in turn strengthens the material at the structural level. This means stronger and tougher airplane parts and car components, and more resilient protective gears.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike straight carbon nanotubes, HCNTs have a coiled structure that enable mechanical&nbsp;interlocking within resin matrices and in between the traditional microfiber reinforcements used in composites. Through a series of chemical functionalization techniques &mdash; using controlled acid treatments and proprietary processing &mdash; Askari&rsquo;s team was able to disperse these nanotubes more effectively into epoxy resins and achieve improved tensile strength, fracture toughness, modulus, strain-to-failure and hardness, even at ultra-low weight percentages.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our nanocomposite technology helps create lightweight materials with improved mechanical, electrical and thermal properties,&rdquo; Askari says. &ldquo;And because our processes are compatible with existing manufacturing techniques, they can be scaled up and adopted across industries.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The novel&nbsp;materials are currently being evaluated in collaboration with industry partners for use in aerospace structures and other high-performance applications. The innovation is protected by two patents related to the functionalization of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uspto.report/patent/app/20190382269\" target=\"_blank\">helical nanotubes</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190308905A1/en\" target=\"_blank\">creation of interlocking nanocomposite structures</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, this is about reliability,&rdquo; Askari adds. &ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re designing spacecraft, submarines or medical devices, materials that are stronger and lighter can make a tremendous difference in safety, efficiency and cost.&rdquo;</p>"

The aircraft&rsquo;s maximum operating speed has increased to Mach 0.935 from Mach 0.925.</p>\n\n<div class=\"article-figure fl-r m-l-2 m-t-1\">\n<div class=\"article_sidebar\">\n<p>In 2022,&nbsp;GKN Aerospace&nbsp;(Redditch, U.K.) was <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/gkn-aerospace-named-supplier-of-all-gulfstream-g800-g400-business-jets\" target=\"_blank\">selected as a supplier</a> for Gulfstream&rsquo;s G800 and G400. This includes the design and manufacture of empennages and aerostructures, using its expertise in metallics and thermoplastic composites.</p>\n\n<p>The G800&rsquo;s first flight was that same year in late June, followed by its first international flight mid-July.</p>\n\n<p>The company says entry into service is anticipated to&nbsp;begin shortly after receiving type certification.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In addition, the G800 was certified with a balanced field length takeoff distance of 5,812 feet (ft)/1,771 meters (m) and a landing distance of 3,105 ft/946 m&nbsp;(standard ISA day, sea level), both shorter than initially announced, giving customers access to more airports.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;With the certification of the G800, Gulfstream has again exceeded expectations thanks to the expertise and rigor of our flight test, certification and manufacturing teams,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Mark Burns, president of Gulfstream. &ldquo;The G800 marks the latest evolution of business aviation as we continue to build the next-generation fleet and bring industry-leading performance and efficiency to the market.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In addition to optimized flight, the G800 offers passengers a range of improved cabin comfort features. The aircraft&rsquo;s&nbsp;ultra-long range, high-speed performance and enhanced fuel-efficiency is&nbsp;attributed to the combination of Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines and the Gulfstream-designed aerodynamic wing and winglet.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have been preparing for this accomplishment and are poised for a seamless G800 entry into service as U.S. and European customer deliveries begin.&rdquo;</p>"
