KCL&rsquo;s biocomposite materials &mdash;&nbsp;3D printing granules enhanced with sustainably sourced fibers &mdash; have now been successfully tested with CEAD&rsquo;s hybrid large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM) systems, confirming their compatibility and opening new opportunities for bio-based, circular production.</p>\n\n<p>At the heart of this collaboration is KCL Formi, biocomposites specifically developed for large-format 3D printing.

The prototype passed radio&nbsp;frequency (RF)&nbsp;testing to expected values in ranges competitive to more expensive materials. While testing the viability of the material for high-performance radomes, the program was also testing if the core material will be dielectrically compatible with this new quartz surface.</p>\n\n<p>The&nbsp;prototype is RWC&rsquo;s first use of this recently <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/renegade-materials-earns-ncamp-certification-for-low-dielectric-prepreg\" target=\"_blank\">NCAMP-certified</a><a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/news/renegade-materials-earns-ncamp-certification-for-low-dielectric-prepreg\" target=\"_blank\"> material</a> developed by <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/suppliers/renegade-materials\" target=\"_blank\">Renegade Materials</a> (Miamisburg, Ohio, U.S.). The prototype radome comprises the Renegade RM-2014-LDk-Tk 4581 8HS quartz material and Rohacell foam core in a sandwich configuration. The panel was&nbsp;produced without tooling on a very compressed schedule. Without the added time and cost of tooling, systems-level RF testing was still possible while meeting delivery targets. The material itself also offers&nbsp;a lower-cost alternative to RWC&rsquo;s current preferred material with very close dielectric compatibility; the prototype&nbsp;supports view angles as low as 25&deg; and performs over 17.7-21.2 and 27.5-31 gigahertz.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Use&nbsp;of this [Renegade&rsquo;s] material further enhances RWCs capability to quickly manufacture highly optimized radome panels,&rdquo; says Adam Saunders, program manager, RWC.&nbsp;&ldquo;The cost efficiency also expands the accessibility of an optimized radome to adjacent markets.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>RWC develops, engineers, manufactures and tests composite products for multiple industries including aerospace and defense (radomes;&nbsp;munitions; unmanned systems;&nbsp;reflectors), space (bus structures;&nbsp;solar array panels and wings; launch vehicle structures; optical, payload and deployable structures), aircraft (new and replacement parts) and commercial equipment (automation;&nbsp;medical;&nbsp;energy;&nbsp;and sporting).
