This recognition marks Thermolysis as one of the few Asian companies honored for outstanding innovation in sustainable material applications, showcasing Taiwan&rsquo;s innovation in next-generation green construction materials on the global stage.</p>\n\n<p>The Materialica&nbsp;Design + Technology Award is&nbsp;an international competition that recognizes innovation at the intersection of materials, technology&nbsp;and design.&nbsp;It is awarded to projects in categories like Material, Process, Product and CO<sub>2</sub> Efficiency, with evaluation criteria including innovation, sustainability&nbsp;and engineering.&nbsp;The awards are presented at the eMove360&deg; event in Munich and showcase innovative contributions from various sectors.</p>\n\n<p>Thermolysis&nbsp;uses its patented microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) process to recycle carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) waste, turning discarded composite materials into clean, high-quality rCF (read &ldquo;...<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/products/thermolysis-features-excfiber-for-concrete-reinforcement\">ExCfiber for concrete reinforcement</a>&rdquo;). After surface modification and advanced dispersion treatment, the fibers achieve optimal uniformity in cement, effectively preventing agglomeration. Moreover, this technology realizes a complete circular economy pathway &mdash; from waste to regeneration to performance enhancement.</p>\n\n<p>According to Thermolysis&rsquo;s internal testing, its rCF concrete&nbsp;shows a range of improvements over conventional cement including a 58.9% increase in compressive strength,&nbsp;55.8% increase in flexural strength, 45.7% increase in split tensile strength, 30.6 times&nbsp;higher impact resistance at 50 joules&nbsp;and 12.9 times&nbsp;at 75 joules. These performance gains, Thermolysis reports, enable buildings and infrastructure made with rCF concrete to achieve longer service life, fewer cracks and leaks&nbsp;and reduced maintenance frequency, resulting in substantial savings in total ownership cost over time.</p>"

The company drew on this technology to create a recycled carbon fiber (rCF) nonwoven fabric.</p>\n\n<p>Toray has begun providing prototype samples to customers,&nbsp;with the goal of using the rCF nonwoven fabric materials for diverse performance- and decorative-driven applications, such as automobiles, construction, electrical and electronics, and daily necessities. The company will push ahead with technical assessments matching customer needs.</p>\n\n<p>Chemical recycling as a reducing agent in steel furnaces, is gaining traction for recycling CFRP. Technologies are also emerging that pyrolize CFRP waste at&nbsp;high temperatures to recover and reuse fibers, particularly for injection molding applications (read &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/trends-fueling-the-composites-recycling-movement\">Trends fueling the composites recycling movement</a>&rdquo;).&nbsp;To broaden the latter&rsquo;s reuse, Toray says there is a need for technology that can suppress the thermal damage to rCF (occurs when exposing carbon fibers to high temperatures or oxidization during pyrolysis) and to control resin residue left on the surface of rCF&nbsp;during separation.</p>\n\n<p>Toray applied its accumulated expertise in organic synthesis and polymer polymerization to innovate a decomposition agent that breaks down degradation-resistant, 3D-cross-linked thermoset resins at lower temperatures than conventional methods. The company used this agent to decompose CFRP waste from aircraft, wind turbines, automobiles&nbsp;and other sources. The rCF achieved&nbsp;from this process retains more than&nbsp;95% of the single-fiber tensile strength of petroleum-derived virgin carbon fiber. Toray expects the technology&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions to be less than half of those from manufacturing virgin carbon fiber.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Toray reports that rCF from this&nbsp;technology is stronger than conventional counterparts and minimizes fiber breakage in postprocessing. Its low resin residue and high surface quality enables processing for more diverse applications. In particular, efforts to disperse short fibers and process them into sheet form nonwoven fabrics have been&nbsp;successful. RCFs exhibit controllable water dispersibility, enabling the fabrication of uniform nonwoven structures as well as those with distinctive texture reminiscent of washi (traditional Japanese paper). This fabric combines the functionality of carbon fiber, including radio frequency shielding and thermal conductivity, with the aesthetic appeal of washi. Toray aims to expand applications for this new material across many industries.</p>\n\n<p>The rCF nonwoven was featured in&nbsp;interior and exterior components of Mazda Motor Corp.&rsquo;s concept car shown at&nbsp;Japan Mobility Show in Tokyo.</p>"

This milestone follows an earlier agreement signed in April 2023 by Airbus CEO, Guillaume Faury and the Tianjin Free Trade Zone Investment Co. Ltd. and Aviation Industry Corp. of China Ltd. Preparations to assemble the first aircraft are underway and full operation of the facility is targeted for early 2026.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We welcome the addition of Tianjin&rsquo;s second line to our global production system, as it provides us with the necessary flexibility and capacity to deliver on our plan to assemble 75&nbsp;A320 Family&nbsp;aircraft per month in 2027,&rdquo; says Faury. &ldquo;Over the past 40 years of our presence here in the country, we have come a long way in establishing trustful partnerships with the China civil aviation community, and we look forward to writing the next chapters of our future together.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The FAL line will enable Airbus to significantly increase production close to its customers in China and beyond. It complements the global Airbus production network of 10 FALs &mdash;&nbsp;four in Hamburg (Germany), two in Toulouse (France), two in Mobile, Alabama in the U.S.&nbsp;and two in Tianjin (China). The advanced second line features Airbus&rsquo; latest technologies and processes to produce aircraft worldwide at the same company&rsquo;s highest standards. In addition, the facility takes advantage of electricity from renewable sources, reclaimed water and geothermal energy to support the company&rsquo;s sustainability roadmap, reducing Airbus&rsquo; environmental footprint.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Inaugurated in 2008, the Airbus Tianjin FAL was the first Airbus production line for commercial aircraft outside Europe. It has assembled and delivered more than 780 A320 Family aircraft since then, making the facility a symbol of successful Sino-European cooperation.&nbsp;</p>"

The company&rsquo;s&nbsp;family of thermal protection systems (TPS) can be &ldquo;can be applied to various surfaces, <a href=\"https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/structured-air-tps-safeguards-composite-structures\" target=\"_blank\">including carbon fiber composites</a>,&rdquo; according to the company. AeroZero FTB in particular is especially applicable for composite applications in the aerospace and defense industries, including eVTOLS.</p>\n\n<p>With the continuing global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and aerospace electrification, Blueshift&rsquo;s latest addition to its AeroZero&nbsp;family is ideal for a wide range of applications and industries that may&nbsp;experience extreme temperature fluctuations &mdash; from EVs and aerospace markets&nbsp;to marine and rail.</p>\n\n<p>For example, within the field of EVs, FTBs are primarily used as a safety barrier material aimed at preventing the transfer of extreme heat or fire that can result in mechanical damage of battery cells and exposure to high temperatures or discharge events. Blueshift&rsquo;s AeroZero&nbsp;FTBs can withstand exposure up to 1200&deg;C for 30 minutes while&nbsp;maintaining a cold-side temperature below 300&deg;C. This means they may&nbsp;either be used as safety features in preventing uncontrolled fire, for example, due to an aircraft engine fire, or protecting surfaces from direct exposure to flame such as during a rocket takeoff or helping to mitigate the risk of a battery thermal runaway event.</p>\n\n<p>Outperforming traditional mica, silica or polyurethane foams, AeroZero&nbsp;FTBs are up to 80% lighter, with a thickness range of 0.32-1.77 mm &mdash; significantly thinner than conventional barriers (3-10 mm). Alongside this, their ease-of-use and flexibility is a key factor in their application; with their &ldquo;peel-and-stick&rdquo;&nbsp;pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) backing that simplifies installation on irregular surfaces, labor time and cost can be reduced.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Traditional thermal insulators have often been based on polymeric foams or ceramic blankets that can suffer from drawbacks due to their added weight, thickness, toxic off-gassing, lack of flexibility and processing issues,&rdquo; says Tim Burbey, Blueshift president.&nbsp;&ldquo;Available across multiple ranges, we look to incorporate as many vehicles and industries as possible, so everyone can overcome their unique thermal challenges.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The AeroZero&nbsp;FTBs family includes, AZ-FTB 100 for up to 500&deg;C applications; AZ-FTB 101 for up to 800&deg;C; and AZ-FTB 300 for maximum protection up to 1200&deg;C. These advanced FTBs are ideal for protection in EV battery modules, and aerospace components that see indirect and direct exposure to flames.</p>"
